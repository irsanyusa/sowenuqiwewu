According to the death certificate, he died from an advanced form of prostate cancer, which had spread to his bones. Goodman’s battle with cancer had been largely hidden from the public eye, but fellow judge <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bruno Tonioli</a> admits he knew of the diagnosis.</p><p>In 2009, Goodman had initially been diagnosed with prostate cancer. However, he chose to keep this diagnosis a closely guarded secret, sharing it only with his closest family and confidants. He decided to postpone a necessary operation until after Season 31 of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dancing With The Stars</a> had finished filming.</p><p>Despite initial hopes of a successful recovery, the cancer later returned, taking on a more aggressive form. Len Goodman’s death certificate, as reported by the Express, officially listed his cause of death as metastatic prostate cancer, signifying the advanced stage of the disease where cancer cells had spread to the bones and other parts of the body.</p><p>Len Goodman’s contribution to the world of dance and television was immeasurable. He withdrew from the U.K. version of Strictly Come Dancing in 2016, making way for Shirley Ballas to take the reins. However, he continued to be a part of the U.S. version known as DWTS until November. In recognition of his legacy, the show renamed their coveted Mirrorball trophy after him.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-len-goodman-died-during-his-retirement>Len Goodman Died During His Retirement</h2><p>Len Goodman had retired just six months prior to his passing but remained an active presence in the public eye. He was last seen enjoying himself at the Celebrity Gold Classic in Hertfordshire in July, marking what would be his final public appearance.</p><p>His retirement from Dancing With The Stars, as he explained during his last TV appearance in November, was motivated by a desire to spend more time with his grandchildren and family back in Britain. Len <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Goodman’s career</a> in dance began in his twenties. He retired from the professional circuit after winning the British Exhibition Championships in Blackpool an impressive four times.</p><p>Throughout his life, Goodman faced various health challenges, including arthritis and knee surgery in 2015. He refused to take time off from Strictly Come Dancing following the procedure. Displaying his trademark enthusiasm even while using crutches.</p><p>Following his death, tributes poured in from across the entertainment world for the beloved entertainer.
