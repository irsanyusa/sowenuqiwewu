He also says that he supports affirmative action for gays and lesbians.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In another questionnaire for Chicago LGBT newspaper <i>Outlines</i>, Obama says he supports same-sex marriage. In 2009, a copy of his typed responses was unearthed and <a href=# rel=noopener>printed</a> in the <i>Windy City Times. </i>“I favor legalizing same-sex marriages, and would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages,” reads the questionnaire bearing his signature at the bottom. Later, Obama aides <a href=# rel=noopener>will dispute</a> that he actually filled out the questionnaire himself.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">1998: Obama is ‘undecided’ about same-sex marriage</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/windy-city-times-obama-1.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Seeking reelection in Illinois, Obama fills out <a href=# rel=noopener>another questionnaire</a> for <i>Outlines</i>, which the Windy City Times published in 2009.

She had been hurt, feeling he suggested that she and people like here were “bad people.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He wrote: “And I was reminded that it is my obligation, not only as an elected official in a pluralistic society but also as a Christian, to remain open to the possibility that my unwillingness to support gay marriage is misguided … that Jesus’ call to love one another might demand a different conclusion.”</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">2007: During the Democratic primary, Obama reaffirms support of ‘strong civil unions’ that offer all the rights that come with opposite-sex marriage</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">During an August debate sponsored by groups like the Human Rights Campaign, he also says, “individual denominations have the right to make their own decisions as to whether they recognize same sex couples. My denomination, United Church of Christ, does. Other denominations may make a different decision.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Obama implies that he personally sympathizes with LGBT people, saying, “When you’re a black guy named Barack Obama, you know what it’s like to be on the outside.”</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">2008: As a presidential candidate, Obama pledges to repeal DOMA and ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,’ which banned the service of openly gay troops in the U.S. military</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/obama-rick-warren-saddleback.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He also says, repeatedly, that he is against gay marriage. “I believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman. Now, for me as a Christian — for me — for me as a Christian, it is also a sacred union.

And I think that it is an issue that I wrestle with and think about because I have a whole host of friends who are in gay partnerships. I have staff members who are in committed, monogamous relationships, who are raising children, who are wonderful parents.”</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">December 2010: Obama signs a bill repealing ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/barack-obama-dont-ask-dont-tell.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The same month, he reiterates at a press conference that his stance on same-sex marriage is “constantly evolving.” By July, the Commander-in-Chief formally certifies that the military is ready for the open service of lesbian, gay and bisexual troops.

In <a href=# rel=noopener>an interview</a> with ABC’s Robin Roberts, Obama says he has changed his mind. “At a certain point,” he said, “I’ve just concluded that — for me personally, it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that — I think same-sex couples should be able to get married.”</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">July 2014: Obama signs an executive order protecting LGBT employees working for government contractors</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/obama-lgbt-edith-windsor.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The order applies to a group of workers that, at around 28 million, accounts for about one-fifth of the American workforce. “America’s federal contracts should not subsidize discrimination against the American people,” he says. The federal government, as well as the majority of states, do not have blanket prohibitions on LGBT discrimination.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">December 2014: The Obama Administration interprets the Civil Rights Act as supportive of LGBT rights</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Department of Education articulates a clear stance on gender identity, while the Department of Justice announces that all its attorneys will interpret the federal ban on sex discrimination to include discrimination against transgender Americans.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Under Title IX,” <a href=# rel=noopener>a memo</a> from the Department of Education reads, a school “must treat transgender students consistent with their gender identity in all aspects of the planning, implementation, enrollment, operation, and evaluation of single-sex classes.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“This important shift will ensure that the protections of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 are extended to those who suffer discrimination based on gender identity, including transgender status,” Attorney General Eric Holder <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a>.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">January 2015: Obama becomes the first president to use the word ‘transgender’ in a State of the Union address</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/obama-state-of-the-union.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“As Americans, we respect human dignity,” he <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a>. “That’s why we defend free speech, and advocate for political prisoners, and condemn the persecution of women, or religious minorities, or people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.”</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">April 2015: Obama says that conversion therapy for minors should be banned</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/barack-obama-panama3.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Conversion therapy attempts to “correct” homosexual or transgender feelings.
