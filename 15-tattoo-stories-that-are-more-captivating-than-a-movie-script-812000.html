In&nbsp;this article, we&nbsp;put together <a href=# title=stories data-link=tag>stories</a> from internet users whose ink is&nbsp;something more than just a&nbsp;pretty picture.</p><ul><li>I&nbsp;have 3&nbsp;tiny dots: one on&nbsp;the front of&nbsp;my&nbsp;chest and one on&nbsp;each side of&nbsp;my&nbsp;ribs. I&nbsp;didn’t want them, but they were put there to&nbsp;line up&nbsp;the radiotherapy equipment to&nbsp;accurately zap my&nbsp;<a href=# title=cancer data-link=tag>cancer</a>. Yes, they remind me&nbsp;that I&nbsp;am a&nbsp;warrior.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Sheelagh-Stephenson&nbsp;/ Quora</a></li><li>I&nbsp;am a&nbsp;tattoo artist. Once a&nbsp;girl walked in&nbsp;and asked me&nbsp;to&nbsp;do&nbsp;a&nbsp;tattoo in&nbsp;the shape of&nbsp;a&nbsp;pie under her collarbone. “Why would you want to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;pie?” I&nbsp;wondered. Her reply was weird and brilliant at&nbsp;the same time, “This is&nbsp;what&nbsp;I call my&nbsp;boyfriend, but if&nbsp;we&nbsp;break&nbsp;up, I’ll still have the tattoo. And I&nbsp;love pies, so&nbsp;it’s a&nbsp;win-win choice.”</li><li>I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;meaningful Pikachu tattoo. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;actually 2&nbsp;Pikachus, one bigger and one smaller. I&nbsp;grew up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;single mom who didn’t have the greatest job in&nbsp;the world. Despite the struggle, she always did everything she could to&nbsp;make me&nbsp;happy, including taking me&nbsp;to&nbsp;see the first Pokémon movie every night for the first week it&nbsp;was open at&nbsp;our local theater.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Lunar_IX&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p><h2>“This tattoo honors my&nbsp;stillborn sister, miscarried child, and me&nbsp;and my&nbsp;little sisters.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/063/ced/9095a052a9b750b1fe53d41d52.jpg><ul><li>In&nbsp;school, I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;classmate who was the nerdiest girl I&nbsp;knew. She never skipped a&nbsp;single class, knew all answers to&nbsp;the teachers’ questions, was a&nbsp;straight-A student, and was loved by&nbsp;teachers. After high school, she enrolled in&nbsp;some prestigious university, and I’ve heard nothing of&nbsp;her since then.<br>Recently, I&nbsp;visited a&nbsp;tattoo festival because&nbsp;I was looking for an&nbsp;artist (I’d done my&nbsp;own sketch). So, I&nbsp;was walking around and looking at&nbsp;the work from different artists, when suddenly&nbsp;I heard someone calling my&nbsp;name. I&nbsp;turned around and saw a&nbsp;girl approaching&nbsp;me. She was all covered in&nbsp;tattoos, and had colored lenses, dreadlocks, and piercings in&nbsp;every possible place.<br>She turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;that classmate, and I’d never have recognized her. So, we&nbsp;talked, recalled our school time, and agreed that she’d do&nbsp;my&nbsp;tattoo. It’s amazing how people can change over time!</li><li>My&nbsp;tattoo has 2&nbsp;meanings. It’s a&nbsp;dragonfly seen from below as&nbsp;it&nbsp;soars into the air. Its first meaning is&nbsp;freedom from my&nbsp;old life of&nbsp;being humiliated. The second meaning is&nbsp;joy in&nbsp;my&nbsp;new life. I&nbsp;drew it&nbsp;myself, and an&nbsp;amazing tattoo artist translated it&nbsp;onto my&nbsp;skin.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Tammy-Snyder&nbsp;/ Quora</a></li><li>I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;mom heart tattoo on&nbsp;my&nbsp;shoulder. I&nbsp;got it&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;college break.<br>My&nbsp;mom, who is&nbsp;covered in&nbsp;tattoos, was like, “I&nbsp;am going to&nbsp;the tattoo parlor, wanna come?” And I&nbsp;was like, “I&nbsp;don’t have any money.” And she was like, “I&nbsp;could use the company, I’ll pay for&nbsp;it.” So&nbsp;I&nbsp;figured if&nbsp;she was paying for&nbsp;it, it&nbsp;might as&nbsp;well be&nbsp;a&nbsp;tattoo for her.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;mister_sleepy/ Reddit</a></li><li>Last winter, I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;happy couple in&nbsp;their twenties walk in&nbsp;wanting tattoos. I&nbsp;didn’t think much of&nbsp;it&nbsp;because we&nbsp;take walk-ins every day. The girl goes first and got a&nbsp;small heart on&nbsp;her wrist.<br>The guy goes second and gets a&nbsp;traditional diamond tattoo. It’s basically just a&nbsp;really simple cartoon version of&nbsp;a&nbsp;diamond. I&nbsp;ask him why he&nbsp;wants this, and he&nbsp;just says he&nbsp;likes the design. They both leave happy.<br>A&nbsp;week later, I&nbsp;got a&nbsp;message from the girl thanking me&nbsp;for making their tattoo day so&nbsp;special. The guy proposed to&nbsp;her later that evening after being together for 5&nbsp;years. He&nbsp;got the tattoo to&nbsp;commemorate their engagement while she had no&nbsp;idea that he&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;propose. This still warms my&nbsp;heart every time&nbsp;I think about&nbsp;it.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;S****yandcute&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p><h2>“My&nbsp;first tattoo.

My&nbsp;ex-fiancé and&nbsp;I got matching tattoos, but when we&nbsp;were in&nbsp;the tattoo studio, we&nbsp;weren’t ex-fiancés. We&nbsp;were friends. We&nbsp;were laughing, sharing stories about our 13&nbsp;years (almost!) of&nbsp;friendship, and neither of&nbsp;us mentioned that we&nbsp;used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;wolfnsunflowers&nbsp;/ Twitter</a></li><li>I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;Kraken calf tattoo.

They all have personal meanings. I&nbsp;have my&nbsp;kids’ initials (one on&nbsp;each hip), a&nbsp;big one on&nbsp;my&nbsp;belly to&nbsp;“decorate” my&nbsp;childbearing marks, an&nbsp;owl on&nbsp;a&nbsp;branch because my&nbsp;mom loved owls, and 2&nbsp;rounded Celtic trinities to&nbsp;represent the 3&nbsp;stages of&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman (maiden, mother, and wise woman). <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Shelley-Ollig&nbsp;/ Quora</a></li></ul><p><h2>“I’m going through a&nbsp;divorce and this simple tattoo in&nbsp;my&nbsp;mom’s handwriting gives me&nbsp;strength.

This is&nbsp;often the assumption when I&nbsp;am standing in&nbsp;line at&nbsp;the grocery store, and someone asks what the pi&nbsp;symbol on&nbsp;my&nbsp;neck means.<br>18&nbsp;years ago this year, my&nbsp;brother and&nbsp;I were adopted together out of&nbsp;foster care. Our adoption was finalized on&nbsp;March 14th (PI&nbsp;day: 3.14). To&nbsp;us, adoption is&nbsp;very important because it&nbsp;gave&nbsp;us the opportunity to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;family. Against all odds, my&nbsp;brother and&nbsp;I were also able to&nbsp;be&nbsp;adopted together. Considering the small detail that we&nbsp;are “half-siblings,” it&nbsp;really was amazing that we&nbsp;were placed together in&nbsp;the same family.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Tina-Bauer&nbsp;/ Quora</a></li><li>My&nbsp;husband took me&nbsp;to&nbsp;meet his grandparents. They were really nice people, and we&nbsp;talked a&nbsp;lot, and they showed me&nbsp;their old photos. In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;them, there was a&nbsp;young man who was getting a&nbsp;tattoo on&nbsp;his chest, and a&nbsp;beautiful young woman was standing next to&nbsp;him and holding his hand.<br>They were my&nbsp;husband’s grandparents. I&nbsp;asked them about this photo, and the grandfather proudly showed me&nbsp;the tattoo on&nbsp;his chest, which said, “I&nbsp;love Nora F&nbsp;endlessly.” They’ve been together for 68&nbsp;years.</li><li>Once, in&nbsp;childhood, I&nbsp;was playing with some kids in&nbsp;the street, and we&nbsp;began to&nbsp;brag in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;each other. One of&nbsp;the kids said that his father had a&nbsp;sport bike, and another one replied that his father had 2&nbsp;bikes like this. And&nbsp;I, for some unknown reason, blabbed that my&nbsp;mother had a&nbsp;skull tattoo.<br>I&nbsp;have no&nbsp;idea why&nbsp;I said&nbsp;it, but everyone started laughing at&nbsp;me. They demanded that&nbsp;I bring my&nbsp;mom, so&nbsp;she could show them her tattoo, and I&nbsp;refused, saying that she wasn’t home. I&nbsp;couldn’t sleep that night because&nbsp;I knew that if&nbsp;I didn’t provide evidence of&nbsp;my&nbsp;words, I’d have the reputation of&nbsp;a&nbsp;liar.<br>In&nbsp;the morning, I&nbsp;went to&nbsp;my&nbsp;mom and told her everything. She thought a&nbsp;bit and then said that she’d always dreamed of&nbsp;having a&nbsp;tattoo. That day, she went to&nbsp;a&nbsp;tattoo salon and got a&nbsp;skull tattoo. She saved&nbsp;me!</li><li>I&nbsp;got my&nbsp;first tattoo and wanted to&nbsp;show it&nbsp;off. I&nbsp;wanted something meaningful, and my&nbsp;first thoughts went to&nbsp;my&nbsp;kids. The tattoo is&nbsp;a&nbsp;radial soundwave of&nbsp;my&nbsp;2&nbsp;kids saying, “I&nbsp;love you, dad.” The tattoo artist said she had never tattooed something like that before.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Dorkmaster79&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p>Are you a&nbsp;fan of&nbsp;the tattoo art?
