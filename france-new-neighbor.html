Moreover, the realization grew that this new Spanish neighbor, puppet of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, might not prove to be the friendly one that France has known for more than 100 years.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">All during the Spanish War France has been scarcely on speaking terms with Generalissimo Francisco Franco’s Government. Unlike Britain, she has sent no friendly, trade mission to Burgos. Last week, however, France thought the time had come to begin a series of diplomatic flirtations if not an actual marriage. Hawk-beaked Rightist Senator Léon Bérard of the Basses-Pyrenees Department entrained for Burgos from Paris. His trip, he and the French Foreign Office said, was unofficial, but there was no doubt that he had been sent by Premier Edouard Daladier’s Government to sound out the possibility of establishing “friendly relations.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Seen off at Paris by José Maria Quiñones de LeÓn, unofficial agent of Rebel Spain in France and longtime Ambassador to France of King Alfonso XIII, M. Berard would say only that he was going to Burgos to “settle some questions with good neighbors.” Obviously referring to British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain’s appeasement trips, he pointed slyly to an umbrella he was carrying, called it “standard equipment on the kind of trip I am making.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Generalissimo Franco soon responded to the French hints of possible friendship. The French have long dreaded the idea of having the Italian legionnaires fighting with the Rebels at the French frontier. No less pleasing has been the thought that the Rebels’ friends have been constructing fortifications on the French-Spanish frontier. Last week the Generalissimo informed France that Italian troops would not be allowed to operate in the frontier sector, and at the same time withdrew an Italian militia brigade from the Catalonian shambles. He also invited a French military mission to come and see for itself that no fortifications in Spain menaced France. They came, they saw, they went home satisfied.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">If this was good news to France, the Spanish news that came from Italy was decidedly bad. Dictator Benito Mussolini has often promised that once Generalissimo Franco has his victory he would retire his troops from Spain. Last week, however, Virginio Gayda, Dictator Mussolini’s journalistic spokesman, revealed that Italy has a far different kind of “victory” in mind than have France and Great Britain. What Italy meant by “victory,” Signor Gayda cagily explained, was not only a “military victory” but “full political victory.” Said he:</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Italian legionnaires will not leave Spanish territory until it has been completely purged of Red armed forces and of the surrounding corrosive influences of their friends. . . .”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9ub3FgboJwstGapZydXaOyuHnNnqCgoJKkv3A%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gyles-brandreth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Gyles Brandreth popularity &amp;amp; fame</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./transport-fluvial-comment-mieux-suivre-le-courant.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>comment mieux suivre le courant ?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1605899-sosoliso-plane-crash-survivor-kechi-dazzles-fans-photoshoot-flaunts-body-pics-year.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./doja-cat.html>Doja Cat (Rapper and Singer-Songwriter)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lassemblee-abroge-le-versement-transport-interstitiel-destine-aux-regions.html>L'Assemble abroge le versement transport interstitiel destin aux rgions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./projet-de-loi-3ds-lassemblee-adopte-et-modifie-les-disposition-sur-le-logement-et-lurbanisme.html>l'Assemble adopte et modifie les disposition sur le logement et l'urbanisme</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./publication-dun-projet-de-ccag-fournitures-courantes-et-services.html>Publication d'un projet de CCAG fournitures courantes et services</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaSync.
