Poverty is so pervasive in Nigeria.</p><p>“We are happy that the workshop has been able to train school leaders from different private schools</p><p>“So, when they go back to their schools, they will hire better and they will also send those who don’t have the credentials, who are already teaching, back to school.</p><p>“Back to school doesn’t mean they have to abandon their jobs. They can study alongside the jobs they do,” Ogudoro said.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>He added that, as a nation, the country had not invested in science education adequately.</p><p>The educationist noted that even the children who were studying sciences were not studying it in a way that they could become globally competitive.</p><p>Ogudoro said, “That is how it comes when people graduate as engineers in Nigeria, yet, they can’t fix anything”.</p><p>He said they could not fabricate anything because there was so much of road learning, adding that they just cram and get A’s in school certificates.</p><p>“However, that is not where the world is. We are trying to change that by helping these children, especially those who have shown some interest in it.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“And also have the gift that enables them to go with science. We are equipping them with proper training in that area.</p><p>“And we know that our universities in the country are not equipped to make them the kind of engineers we want them to be.</p><p>“People who will fix our electricity challenge, fix our roads. So we are sending them out to the U.S. We demand it.</p><p>“Of course, most of their parents can’t afford the education that is offered in the U.S. So we are giving them education that will enable them to get that education for free.”</p><p>Ogudoro said that 20 students would get scholarships worth over N400 million from the community and its partners.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>He noted that the mandate was that these students would receive the best education, and then come back to help Nigeria to move forward.</p><p>Ogudoro added that the community was conducting intensive classroom work in August, following the students up and also preparing them to write international exams.</p><p>Also speaking, a School Proprietress from a school in Kano, <strong>Mrs Naime Jahum</strong>, blamed the present situation on the rate of unemployment.</p><p>Jahum alleged that unregistered private schools were after profit and some of them did not bother about the quality of education the pupils receive.</p><p>She urged schools across the country to imbibe the reading culture in their school curriculum.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0mijqJuRoXy1scCcn56qo2K2r3nNop6eqpmWu2681JujoptdqLCpu86lqmavlaG5bsDRmqCnnZRiwq%2B4yKScZqGeYr2ztdWaq55lo5i1sLvLrGajapqrtHa9</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./team-blakes-hailey-green-faces-off-against-libianca-in-the-voice-knockouts.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Team Blake's Hailey Green Faces Off Against Libianca in 'The Voice' Knockouts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./signature-du-contrat-de-concession-du-nouvel-aeroport-de-nantes.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Signature du contrat de concession du nouvel aroport de Nantes</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1605899-sosoliso-plane-crash-survivor-kechi-dazzles-fans-photoshoot-flaunts-body-pics-year.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./doja-cat.html>Doja Cat (Rapper and Singer-Songwriter)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lassemblee-abroge-le-versement-transport-interstitiel-destine-aux-regions.html>L'Assemble abroge le versement transport interstitiel destin aux rgions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./projet-de-loi-3ds-lassemblee-adopte-et-modifie-les-disposition-sur-le-logement-et-lurbanisme.html>l'Assemble adopte et modifie les disposition sur le logement et l'urbanisme</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./publication-dun-projet-de-ccag-fournitures-courantes-et-services.html>Publication d'un projet de CCAG fournitures courantes et services</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaSync.
