Black tees are incredibly versatile—they go with the majority of items in your closet, making them a reliable addition to just about any outfit.</p><p>Black t-shirts are also quite flattering, no matter your body type or size. They can create the illusion of a slimmer, lengthier silhouette, which is why they’re so popular and in-demand among people of so many different shapes and sizes. Black is also less likely to show stains and spills compared to lighter-colored clothing, which can be especially practical in messy situations.</p><p>Needless to say, this versatility and timelessness makes them a true wardrobe staple, .but finding the right brand and style makes all the difference. Here, we’re sharing some of the best black t-shirts for men based on material, fit, quality, and price.</p><h2 id=how-to-choose-the-best-black-t-shirts-for-men>How to choose the best black t-shirts for men</h2><p>There’s no shortage of black t-shirts on the market–in fact, shopping for one can be surprisingly overwhelming. Keeping these features in mind can help guide your purchase:</p><h3>Fit</h3><p>Most black t-shirts come in a particular fit, most notably slim, regular or relaxed. Regular fit is the most popular since it’s not too tight or too loose, offering a good amount of freedom of movement and versatility for most body types. Slim fits are the most form-fitting, tending to hug the body, making them ideal for those looking for a more modern and tailored look. Lastly, the relaxed fit is best for those looking for a loose-fitting t-shirt, as it’s the most casual style.</p><h3>Fabric</h3><p>T-shirts can be made from a number of different fabrics, with the most common being cotton. Cotton is breathable and great for everyday wear, however, it can shrink in the wash. Cotton blends tend to be part cotton and part synthetic materials, like polyester. These are worth checking out because they add some moisture-wicking abilities to the equation, though they can often feel like your <a rel=alternate href=#>best men’s workout shirt</a>. Other t-shirts are made out of a combination of more than just the two blends, often including rayon for added comfort and softness.</p><h3>Style</h3><p>Black t-shirts, as with any color t-shirt, come in various styles, with the most popular being crew neck, V-neck and Henley, which is traditionally a collarless pullover shirt with just two or three buttons. Style is truly an individual decision and may depend on what looks and feels best for you.</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-the-best-black-t-shirts-for-men>Our top picks for the best black t-shirts for men</h2><h3>Best v-neck black t-shirt for men: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Bombas Men's Pima Cotton V-Neck T-Shirt</a></h3><p>Bombas might be best known for their comfort-focused socks, but they also make some high-quality t-shirts that are built to last just as long.
