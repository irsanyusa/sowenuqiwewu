Flash forward to nearly two decades later and he has turned into a bit of a softie judging <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">America’s Got Talent</a> and Britain’s Got Talent. Whether you love him or love to hate him, Cowell’s life hasn’t always been full of riches and success.</strong> <strong>It has been marred by tragedy that he has had to overcome to shape him into the millionaire music mogul he is today.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-simon-cowell-dropped-out-of-school-at-16>1. Simon Cowell Dropped Out of School at 16</h2><p>Cowell’s teenage years were full of getting into trouble at school. He was enrolled in Dover College in Kent, England when he was 14 years old. Cowell was anything but happy about attending this school away from his family. He felt like they were trying to get rid of him. From writing his parent’s angry notes to constantly getting suspended, he knew school wasn’t for him and decided to drop out at the age of 16.</p><p>As a teen, Cowell had a growing interest in the music industry. His father was a music executive at EMI Music Publishing and clearly the source of his inspiration. It was only a matter of time before he followed in his father’s footsteps and took a crack at breaking into the entertainment industry himself.</p><p>But Cowell couldn’t just walk right into the EMI Music Publishing office and ask for a job. First, he built up his resume by taking odd jobs. He got a job as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a runner on the set of the 1980 film The Shining.</a> After facing friction with his co-workers on set, Cowell left the job for good.</p><p>Finally, after tons of failed jobs didn’t work out for Cowell, he landed a job as a mailroom clerk at EMI Music Publishing. Here he realized how much power there is in networking and making connections with other people.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-his-first-music-label-was-a-bust>2. His First Music Label was a Bust</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Cowell was able to get a position as a talent scout for an A&R executive at EMI. This provided him with a ton of hands-on experience and exposed him to a new side of the music industry. He felt it was finally time to leave the company and start one of his own with his business partner.</p><p>Unfortunately, his music company called E&S Music was a total bust. He returned to EMI as he planned his next move. Cowell started Fanfare Records in 1985 with his business partner Iain Burton. Sinitta was putting out hits under the label at the time which allowed them to have a few glory years. But in 1989, the company was facing financial ruin. The label was later sold to BMG.</p><p>Cowell was left incredibly <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">close to being bankrupt</a> and was forced to move back in with his parents. He got a job as a consultant for BMG Records where he set up his own label S Records. He was more determined than ever to find success. S records later became known as Syco Music, the label that has launched the careers of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">One Direction</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>Little Mix</a>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-simon-cowell-s-love-life-has-been-extremely-rocky>3. Simon Cowell’s Love Life has been Extremely Rocky</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B89RVYqAtfI/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><p>Now a father, Cowell has been notoriously known as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a ladies’ man to the public for years.</a> He has also kept in touch with some of his exes and still hangs out with him to this day. He was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>secretly engaged to Page 3 model Louise Payne</a> in 1995. They broke off the engagement in 1998 because Cowell said he wasn’t ready to have children. He wasn’t ready to give up his bachelor lifestyle, which left Louise heartbroken.</p><p>Cowell was engaged once more in 2010 to makeup artist Mezghan Husainy. She struggled with jealousy and the fact that he was close to so many other women that he previously dated. His busy schedule jet-setting all over the world was another cause of concern for her as she felt like she never got to see him. They ended their engagement in 2012. He later revealed that this relationship was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“a big mistake.”</a></p><p>Cowell has finally settled down with partner <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Lauren Silverman</a> but <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">this relationship</a> didn’t come without controversy. She was still married to his friend Andrew at the time of their affair in 2013. The couple divorced after&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# class=broken_link>news of the affair broke</a>&nbsp;and Lauren announced she was pregnant with Cowell’s child. The pair are now parents to 7-year-old Eric who has made several appearances on both&nbsp;America’s Got Talent&nbsp;and&nbsp;Britain’s Got Talent.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-a-scary-electric-bike-accident-left-simon-cowell-with-a-broken-back>4. A Scary Electric Bike Accident Left Simon Cowell with a Broken Back</h3><p>Just as Cowell was settling down with his family, another tragedy struck. He <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fell off his electric bike</a> in the courtyard of his Malibu home in August 2020. After&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>undergoing a six-hour surgery</a>&nbsp;to repair the three broken vertebrae in his back and have a metal rod placed, Simon was on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>road to recovery.&nbsp;</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CDsKbOrDgbq/</p></figure><p>The accident could have killed him. The injury <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sidelined him from the live shows</a> of both Britain’s Got Talent and America’s Got Talent for the remainder of both of the seasons. The 61-year-old underwent intense physical therapy and was up and walking again in a matter of weeks.</p><p>He will make his long-awaited television return when America’s Got Talent premieres on June 1.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SIMON COWELL RESPONDS TO SHOCKING ‘X FACTOR’ ALLEGATIONS</a></strong></p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Simon-Cowell-crying-X-Factor-Celebrity.jpeg alt="Simon Cowell Starts Crying in Emotional Moment on ‘The X Factor’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>simon cowell</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706uYoKGTYsGptc2gqmasmJbBbrTAr5xmoJGlvaa6xJ1kraddqLauu81mmqivlaG5cA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tech-3-accessories-to-make-your-iphone-x-experience-more-complete.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>3 accessories to make your iPhone X experience more complete</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rust-director-joel-souza-alec-baldwin-no-relationship-halyna-hutchins-1236107561.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rust Director Speaks Out on Fatal Shooting, Finishing the Movie and Having No Relatio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1605899-sosoliso-plane-crash-survivor-kechi-dazzles-fans-photoshoot-flaunts-body-pics-year.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./doja-cat.html>Doja Cat (Rapper and Singer-Songwriter)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lassemblee-abroge-le-versement-transport-interstitiel-destine-aux-regions.html>L'Assemble abroge le versement transport interstitiel destin aux rgions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./projet-de-loi-3ds-lassemblee-adopte-et-modifie-les-disposition-sur-le-logement-et-lurbanisme.html>l'Assemble adopte et modifie les disposition sur le logement et l'urbanisme</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./publication-dun-projet-de-ccag-fournitures-courantes-et-services.html>Publication d'un projet de CCAG fournitures courantes et services</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaSync.
