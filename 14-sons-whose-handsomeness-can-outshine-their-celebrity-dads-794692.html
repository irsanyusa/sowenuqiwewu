A&nbsp;23-year-old named Rafferty Law is&nbsp;Jude’s son from his first marriage with actress Sadie Frost. Having inherited subtle facial features from his father, the young man has been working as&nbsp;a&nbsp;model for quite some time and participates in&nbsp;<a href=# title=fashion data-link=tag>fashion</a> shows around the world. Apart from that, Rafferty is&nbsp;fond of&nbsp;<a href=# title=music data-link=tag>music</a> and plays in&nbsp;the band, Dirty Harris.</p><p><h2>2.

Perhaps the only person who can do&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;his <a href=#>son</a>. Alain-Fabien is&nbsp;25&nbsp;years old and acts in&nbsp;<a href=# title=movies data-link=tag>movies</a> and works as&nbsp;a&nbsp;model.

The 29-year-old Chet first decided to&nbsp;follow in&nbsp;the footsteps of&nbsp;his father and film movies but seems to&nbsp;have changed his mind. Today he&nbsp;is&nbsp;composing rap songs. As&nbsp;for the younger son, he&nbsp;maintains an&nbsp;isolated lifestyle and doesn’t like public attention.</p><p><h2>4.

Today, Brooklyn assists famous photographers and does photos for commercial campaigns.</p><p><h2>5. Stellan Skarsgård, Alexander Skarsgård, and Bill Skarsgård</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/800/6cc/c307f75486a0328f933ac1314b.jpg><p>Everyone seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;familiar with the <a href=#>Skarsgård dynasty</a>. Stellan is&nbsp;a&nbsp;happy father of&nbsp;8&nbsp;kids! Many of&nbsp;them have already tied their lives to&nbsp;cinematography.

At&nbsp;the same time, Will’s son from his first marriage, 26-year-old Trey, is&nbsp;hardly spoken about. Nevertheless, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;also fond of&nbsp;music and appears in&nbsp;movies. It’s worth noting that Will has always been actively involved in&nbsp;helping his eldest son build his career.</p><p><h2>9.
