though in a different order - with most championing Stonehenge, putting the Houses of Parliament in second place, and Buckingham Palace in third.</h2><p>When explaining their choices <b>participants often argued that Stonehenge was an ancient and intriguing wonder,</b> representing an undocumented past and attracting visitors with its natural beauty and incredible mystery.</p><p>Those who said the <b>Houses of Parliament should top the list</b> said they favoured its historical and architectural contribution to Britain's national identity, <b>while Buckingham Palace was celebrated</b> as a symbol of the royal family, for its cultural relevance, and its popularity among tourists.</p><p><br>Read the range of reasons given for why Stonehenge, the Houses of Parliament and Buckingham Palace made our participants' top 3:<br></p><h2><b></b><b>1. </b><b>Stonehenge</b></h2><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/PA-stoneh-snow_formatPA.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>“It’s <b>globally recognised</b> and traces the history of these islands back to the days of the Celts and Ancient Britons”</p><p>“It's one of the <b>oldest landmarks</b> and is in <b>an area of natural beauty</b>”</p><p>“It's history that <b>people travel from around the world</b> to see”</p><p>“Because of its <b>age</b> and the <b>mystery</b> that is associated with it. It is also <b>mind-boggling</b> how such huge stones were moved by people so long ago”</p><p>“Stonehenge is <b>such an impressive structure</b>, with so much mystery behind it. Some of the stones were imported from Wales, and this would have been quite a task 20,000 years ago. It is also a mystery how the stones were erected in the first place. The <b>point of Stonehenge is also unknown and widely speculated</b>”</p><p>“Unique and special - a connection to our <b>undocumented human past</b>”</p><p>“It's the most <b>symbolic of our ancient history and heritage</b> and also lends itself to the amazing British landscape”</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/PA-stonehenge_formatPA_s1fdGuE.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>“It <b>shows that we have always been developed on these isles</b> and have <b>always been in touch with the earth moon and sun</b>.

Who built it? Why? How? What did they do there? A magnificent mystery”</p><p>“It's has a <b>unique quality</b> in a way newer buildings do not”</p><p>“Stonehenge is a <b>symbol of strength and endurance</b>, it <b>shows that as a nation we will endure</b> the problems of the present as we did the past troubles and emerge the same British nation”</p><h2><strong>2.</strong> <b>Houses of Parliament</b></h2><p>“It is an imposing symbol of democracy that is recognised the world over”</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/River-westminster_format.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>“It is <b>unique architecturally and historically</b> but also <b>of immense relevance</b>.

It’s a lovely building we can all be proud of”</p><p>“<b>The home of politics and the laws</b>, used as a model all round the world”</p><p>“Because it <b>represents centuries of democracy in Britain</b> and the heart of this great nation”</p><p>“Although it sometimes feels different, we are a democracy in an age when that is a precious commodity. Also it <b>reminds us that it is claimed to be 'The Mother of Parliaments</b>’”</p><p>“Because it symbolises all that democracy should be - which applies equally to our history and our future”</p><p>“It is a <b>magnificent building</b> and within its doors it represents all that we believe in - liberty, justice and freedom of speech”</p><p>“The Houses of Parliament represent our history, culture and politics.

Buckingham Palace</b></h2><p>“<b>This is the landmark that all visitors to and from the UK place at the top of their list.</b> Others may be more spectacular but I believe that this is visitor’s top priority to visit”</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Buckingham-Palace_format.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>“<b>Buckingham Palace is the ‘Home of Great Britain&rsquo</b>; it has been the centre of Britain’s joy and sorrow through the years.

It stands for our history, whether that be glorious or inglorious events... it stands for the British people and what makes us who we are”</p><p>“<b>It is the Prime Landmark for this country</b>, just like the Whitehouse is in America”</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/buck-palace-gates_format.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>“The <b>Monarchy is the nation's best asset</b> and the Palace is of universal importance”</p><p>“It <b>represents everything good about Britain.</b> It is in the heart of the capital London, home of the royal family, great tourist attraction”</p><p>“It is old yet <b>still relevant.</b> It is understood (unlike Stonehenge). It <b>captures the look and feel of something British</b> in terms of appearance and it evokes feelings of affection among many British people”</p><h2><strong>4.
