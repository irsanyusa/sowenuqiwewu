Bush walked his daughter Barbara down the aisle on Sunday as she married her fiancée Craig Coyne in a small ceremony at the family's Kennebunkport, Maine compound, Walker Point.</p><p>The wedding came as a surprise to many since Barbara and her screenwriter beau had kept their romance private, according to <a href=# id=eeeb4da5-415d-5d1c-8919-28b3a728bbca>People</a>. The couple were set up by friends last November and were long-distance until this week, when Coyne moved in with his bride in New York City.</p><p>"It's just been a very sweet romance.

Coyne got down on one knee at the exact location where Bush's grandfather, former President George H.W. Bush, proposed to her grandmother and namesake, Barbara, almost exactly 75 years earlier.</p><p>The wedding was a bittersweet event, as the former first lady died just a few months earlier, in April, at the age of 92. But Bush honored her by wearing a bracelet her grandfather gifted her grandmother for their 70th anniversary as her "something borrowed." Her dress was a custom design by Vera Wang.</p><p>Bush's twin sister, Jenna Bush Hager, served as matron of honor, while Coyne's brother, Edward Coyne III, was best man. Hager's daughters — five-year-old Mila and three-year-old Poppy — were enlisted as flower girls, along with Coyne's niece Emma, age 5. The bride's aunt, Dorothy Bush Koch, officiated the "very short, sweet ceremony."</p><p>It was a wonderful day in M... @ laurawbush</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Beauty. #emo# @allisonvsmith... @ laurawbush</p><p>Hager told the <a href=# id=2ffda146-3d76-5cac-a70e-13c556c91586>"Today" target="_blank"</a> show that the reason why her sister decided to hold the wedding in Maine was so that their grandfather, who has recently suffered some health issues, could attend.</p><p>"The party was a lot of fun and my grandfather got to stay through the dinner, which was such a blessing and the reason why they wanted to do this here," Hager said.</p><p>Bush's parents shared the happy news on their respective Instagram accounts.</p><p>"It was a wonderful day in Maine when Barbara married her love and Craig joined our family," former first lady <a href=# id=9f699f26-80c3-5564-92f8-d01c4a38b2a4>Laura Bush</a> wrote, alongside a picture of the family gathered together after the nuptials.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Happy tears, heart explodin... @ jennabhager</p><p>Poppy and Poppy!
