This conversation — about Galitzine’s “Mary & George,” the Starz series about George Villiers’ affair with King James I, and Netflix’s “One Day,” starring Woodall as Dexter, who falls in love with his best friend over two decades — marks their first time meeting in person. The heartthrobs’ rapport is immediate, thanks to Instagram DMs they’ve already shared about how, as Galitzine puts it, “a lot of acting prep is very pretentious and twat-y.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>NICHOLAS GALITZINE: </strong>We just found out that we support rival football teams.</p><h2 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-display-block lrv-u-padding-t-075 lrv-u-padding-b-050 lrv-a-font-secondary-l u-color-black">Related Stories</h2><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>LEO WOODALL:</strong> We already kind of hate each other.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>GALITZINE: </strong>The fact that you support Chelsea tells me a lot about who you are as a person. It tells me that you’re plastic; there’s no substance behind you at all. You’re just in it for the glory. Can the same be said about your approach to acting?</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WOODALL: </strong>Incredibly plastic. I fake everything when the camera’s rolling.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>GALITZINE:</strong> I watched the show, “One Day,” and you’re just incredibly human in it. There’s so much content nowadays — the Netflix of it all, the Amazons — but it felt so very real.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WOODALL: </strong>I was fumbling my way through it. Do you ever feel that way?</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>GALITZINE: </strong>Oh yeah, man, all the time. It was kind of different on “Mary & George” because —</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WOODALL:</strong> Which, by the way, congratulations. It was so refreshing. And I felt for you, because we’re basically the same age, London boys, and I was like, “He’s going toe-to-toe with Julianne Moore.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>GALITZINE: </strong>You’ve had this in your career as well, notably “White Lotus.” We work in this industry that oftentimes pits people against each other; you and me probably end up going for all the same parts.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WOODALL:</strong> I auditioned for “Mary & George.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>GALITZINE:</strong> Did you really?</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WOODALL: </strong>Yeah, you bastard!</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>GALITZINE: </strong>I auditioned for “White Lotus.” So you’ve got me there.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WOODALL: </strong>Did you actually? No way!</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>GALITZINE: </strong>But it’s so nice to engage in the human of it all. Julie — I can call her that now, by the way —</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WOODALL:</strong> I was going to say.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>GALITZINE: </strong>She actually goes by “Juju” sometimes. I felt like that was a bit too familiar. But you do think, “Julianne Moore, icon,” and then you meet her in person and she’s so grounded.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WOODALL: </strong>Was it intimidating though? You can be honest. It’s just me and you here, Nick.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Leo-Woodall-Variety-Actors-on-Actors.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>GALITZINE: </strong>Maybe at first. But immediately, we’re scheming. A lot of combativeness. Earlier in [George’s] life, he’s just desperate for love and affection. Then, the more he feels like a pawn in her game, he gathers his own autonomy. A commonality between both of our shows is having to track something over the course of years.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WOODALL: </strong>The thing about Dex — the immediate challenge that I knew I had to overcome — was he had to be redeemable. On the page, it’s very easy to think he’s a bit of a twat, because he kind of is. He does act like a knob half the time. But some really bad things happen to him, and he’s got a lot of love in his heart. He’s on his knees a lot. For someone who’s so privileged, he really gets a crap deal. Like George — you meet him and he’s literally hanging from a tree.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>GALITZINE: </strong>They both do feel sorry for themselves, but it’s not without cause. For George, his mom really wants to send him off to France — at the time, that’s like getting sent to the moon. He’s terrified. And, yes, there is some melodrama with his quite staged suicide attempts.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WOODALL: </strong>Yeah, how true are they?</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>GALITZINE:</strong> I think it’s both. He feels very hopeless. Where we leave George, it’s very tragic, because he’s been used by almost everyone in his life. He’s a commodity. People don’t really look beyond his looks and his powers of seduction, so there’s a desperate want to be loved.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WOODALL: </strong>Then he finds love with James. I was fascinated watching it, because you play it so subtly that I couldn’t work out where the genuineness in it was.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>GALITZINE:</strong> I think it started out as transactional. Then there was a genuine love that brews. And George, his whims get the better of him; his appetite is voracious, and that blows apart the steady home life with the king.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">For something like this, which is such an epic, what’s your lead-up?</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WOODALL:</strong> A lot of the prep happened because I was doing so many auditions. I remember Rachel Sheridan, the casting director, would read with me, and I was breaking down in this audition room. I said a line and I looked up, because she didn’t say her line, and Rachel, she was crying as well. So I reached out and I just touched her foot, and we carried on. After that, I was like, “I know how to play Dex now.” Your process, is it different? I feel like it changes job to job.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Nicholas-Galitzine-Variety-Actors-on-Actors.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>GALITZINE: </strong>I did this film called “Bottoms.” I’ve never done an out-and-out comedy like that. With [my character], Jeff, he’s so ridiculous that there was no way to prep other than watching “Not Another Teen Movie.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WOODALL:</strong> I’ve never done an out-and-out comedy like that. What’s it like?</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>GALITZINE:</strong> Emma Seligman, who directed it, she’d be like, “You’re an infant, and you’re throwing your toys out the pram.” The next day, “You’re a sociopath, and you’re gaslighting this person.” I’m like, “I have no idea who this character is.” Then with George, it’s the opposite, because you have a historical text that you can go to. It was tricky, because I had two weeks, maybe, between wrapping “The Idea of You” to go on to “Mary & George.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WOODALL: </strong>“The Idea of You,” where you play Harry Styles.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>GALITZINE: </strong>Deny, deny, deny, deny! But you’ve done things back to back.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WOODALL: </strong>Knackered, mate.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>GALITZINE: </strong>You’re exhausted. I imagine Dexter took some time to shake off.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WOODALL: </strong>Shaking off Dexter wasn’t that difficult, because we would do these days where I’d just suffer. And things like that, you want to shake them off immediately. By the time we wrapped, I’d been letting it go along the way.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>GALITZINE:</strong> I find that the more I try and sit in a dark energy, the more it drains me. So when it actually comes time to do the scene, I don’t have as much of it. I did a movie a few years ago — which wasn’t fantastic, but I actually feel like I learned a lot — where my character had to really break down crying. It was pretty forced, and the director came up to me and she was like, “This next take, just do nothing.” And that was when it poured out of me.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WOODALL:</strong> So, Nick, how does it feel to be an internet boyfriend?</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>GALITZINE: </strong>Am I an internet boyfriend?</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WOODALL: </strong>I’d say you’re quite solidly an internet boyfriend.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>GALITZINE: </strong>Do you type that into Google, just to see who’s on the list? I mean, you’re an internet boyfriend.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WOODALL:</strong> No. I’ve been typing it, waiting for me to come up.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>GALITZINE: </strong>You’ve been trying to make the algorithm realize that you are an internet boyfriend.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WOODALL: </strong>It’s a silly question, but “Red, White & Royal Blue,” that was a big launching pad for you.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>GALITZINE: </strong>The fans are such fans of the book as well, so I already knew what that was going to be, and just hoped that it matched their expectations. I could ask you the same thing with “One Day” and the Netflix effect of really launching you. Because of “White Lotus,” you were definitely revered. But it’s a whole ’nother level.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WOODALL:</strong> I got a gentle push into the industry, but I’ve been bowled over by how many people watched “One Day.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>GALITZINE: </strong>Your whole family are actors.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WOODALL: </strong>My dad, my stepdad, my grandma. It goes way, way back to a woman called Maxine Elliott. Are you the only actor in your family?</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>GALITZINE: </strong>Yeah. They’re definitely weirded out. They came to the premiere of “Mary & George,” and it was pretty uncomfortable. My dad, in this hypermasculine way, was like, “I’m going to watch this. Men watch their sons do sex scenes.” It was like, “Dad, you really don’t have to. I get that you’re proud.” I did four sex scenes in one day one time, with people who, that was their only scene. So I would welcome them on set like, “OK, we’re in position.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WOODALL: </strong>I had the one scene in “White Lotus.” I watched it with my brother. I didn’t tell anyone that it was going to happen. I recorded him. He was like, “Uhhh!”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>GALITZINE:</strong> I love that. Well, I guess we’ve got to transition out of mate mode.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WOODALL:</strong> Let’s go to the pub.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>GALITZINE: </strong>It’s L.A. They don’t have pubs.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WOODALL: </strong>Get a pub, guys.</p><h6 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-primary-m">Production Design: Keith Raywood</h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiukae2psDYZ5qopV9nfXOAjq2taKaVrMBwusicn6ikkah6qK3LoquzoZ6aeq2xzmauqKeUlrmtedKer2ark5q7pr%2BMmqydoaSevK%2B%2FjGppbG5gZ35yfZRo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./women-working-preserve-welsh-landscapes.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The women working to protect our land</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./plan-pauvrete-manuel-valls-dresse-le-bilan-et-liste-les-mesures-restantes-pour-2016-et-2017.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Manuel Valls dresse le bilan et liste les mesures restantes pour 2016 et 2017</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1605899-sosoliso-plane-crash-survivor-kechi-dazzles-fans-photoshoot-flaunts-body-pics-year.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./doja-cat.html>Doja Cat (Rapper and Singer-Songwriter)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lassemblee-abroge-le-versement-transport-interstitiel-destine-aux-regions.html>L'Assemble abroge le versement transport interstitiel destin aux rgions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./projet-de-loi-3ds-lassemblee-adopte-et-modifie-les-disposition-sur-le-logement-et-lurbanisme.html>l'Assemble adopte et modifie les disposition sur le logement et l'urbanisme</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./publication-dun-projet-de-ccag-fournitures-courantes-et-services.html>Publication d'un projet de CCAG fournitures courantes et services</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaSync.
