The <a href=#>homicide rate</a> spiked. Protesters have clashed with law enforcement. There’s been <a href=#>looting.</a> There’s been <a href=#>violence.</a> At least once Mayor Lori Lightfoot described the actions of demonstrators as <a href=# rel=noopener>“anarchy.”</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But what did city and state officials think would happen? You can’t slowly build a powder keg and then be surprised when it explodes. As someone who grew up on Chicago’s South Side, graduated from Chicago Public Schools and lived in the city most of my life, I’m certainly not.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Chicago remains one of the most <a href=# rel=noopener>segregated metropolitan areas in the U.S</a>, and the South and West Sides, where residents are mostly Black, have faced a decades of neglect and police brutality. A 2018 analysis found that about <a href=# rel=noopener>72% of victims of use of force by Chicago police</a> from 2005 to 2015 were Black. During the coronavirus pandemic, unemployment has reached <a href=# rel=noopener>more than 30% in certain neighborhoods.</a> Meanwhile, Chicago’s Black residents have died of COVID <a href=# rel=noopener>at a disproportionately higher rate</a> than its white ones.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Budget shortfalls are frequently cited when anyone complains about inequality in Chicago schools, transit and every other city service, but how the money is allocated is a reflection of priorities. <a href=# rel=noopener>More than a month after the schools were closed by COVID-19</a>, the city had not yet figured out how to ensure all public school students could continue their learning. In July the city <a href=# rel=noopener>cut funds to a high-performing childcare center</a> in Englewood, a neighborhood that lacks options for working parents and their children. In the middle of a pandemic with a deficit in hospital beds, the state <a href=# rel=noopener>legislature failed to approve funds for a plan intended to keep four hospitals open on the city’s South Side</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Meanwhile, an analysis by the nonprofit journalism organization Injustice Watch found that police spending per capita has <a href=# rel=noopener>nearly tripled</a> in the last 40 years. <a href=# rel=noopener>According to U.S. News, </a>Chicago spends $660 per capita, second only to New York’s $671, whereas Los Angeles spends $436, Houston spends $403 and Phoenix spends $429. This figure is alarming given the falling crime rates in the city since the ‘90s, the <a href=# rel=noopener>low clearance rates</a> for criminal cases and the <a href=# rel=noopener>high cost </a>of officer misconduct lawsuits. Besides, if Chicago were serious about ending violence, one way to show it would be to actually fund the Cook County <a href=# rel=noopener>witness protection program</a>, so that those able to testify against criminals would feel safer doing so.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/chicago-bridge-closed.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While Mayor Lightfoot has talked about the importance of <a href=# rel=noopener>ending poverty</a> and reducing gun violence, she has <a href=# rel=noopener>defended the police</a> again and again this summer even as residents act in desperation. For just one example of the skewed priorities of Chicago politicians, consider what happened this month after hundreds of people looted the city’s Magnificent Mile. Mayor Lightfoot <a href=# rel=noopener>restricted access to the Loop</a>, the city’s downtown area, by ordering river bridges raised. She did this previously in the <a href=# rel=noopener>days after George Floyd’s death</a> when downtown businesses were looted and vandalized, <a href=# rel=noopener>calling in the Illinois National Guard as well</a>. Yet there’s been no such mobilization to make other areas safer <a href=# rel=noopener>despite shootings happening all over the city</a>. The message is clear: The windows in downtown Chicago are more important than the children at risk of violence from gangs and police.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Many have argued that <a href=#>looting</a> is not the solution, that it could undermine legitimate protests and reduce sympathy for the very real issues. But at some point, there must be space to demand accountability for the ways that the city redirects tax dollars away from the places with the greatest need. <a href=# rel=noopener>Corporations rarely pay taxes,</a> but the residents of neighborhoods often decried as the most violent pay a <a href=# rel=noopener>proportionally higher property tax rate</a> and get less for their funds than other communities in the city. Chicago’s misuse of Tax Increment Financing (TIF) funds has also had serious consequences for marginalized communities. While the money is supposed to be earmarked for things like infrastructure improvements and revitalizing commercial strips in underserved communities, it is instead doled out in ways that make <a href=# rel=noopener>already well-off parts of the city even more valuable</a>. Apparently, looting is a legal Chicago pastime when it comes to tax revenues.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At the end of July, President Trump <a href=# rel=noopener>announced a surge in law enforcement </a>as part of what he called <a href=#>Operation LeGend</a>. “For those people in Chicago and other cities where we’ll be: Help is on its way,” he said. This is not the help we need. But I suppose it’s easier to send in officers with weapons to try to control the Black and brown people who live there than to ensure their health, safety and financial well-being.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">What’s happening in Chicago is what happens when people are pushed to the brink. Violence is an epidemic in the city, a <a href=#>public health emergency</a> that politicians refuse to address in any meaningful way. Just as we should pay attention to science when it comes to fighting the coronavirus, we should follow the advice of the experts when it comes to reducing gun violence. And research has found that it is done with <a href=# rel=noopener>investment in low-income neighborhoods</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The situation in Chicago did not come out of nowhere. It is the result of decades of choices about who matters in the eyes of those who control resources. If you continually deprive people of the ability to fulfill even the basic needs of their families, what do you really expect?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZucGhlf3R%2BjpyfopuRnLxuuM6oq6Kml2K2r7HQrpiloaSufA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1345219-does-instagram-notify-screenshot-a-story-post-dm-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Does Instagram notify when you screenshot a story, post, or DM?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./amanda-holden-hits-the-bgt-golden-buzzer-for-the-greatest-showmans-loren-allred.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Amanda Holden Hits the 'BGT' Golden Buzzer For 'The Greatest Showman's Loren Allred</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1605899-sosoliso-plane-crash-survivor-kechi-dazzles-fans-photoshoot-flaunts-body-pics-year.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./doja-cat.html>Doja Cat (Rapper and Singer-Songwriter)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lassemblee-abroge-le-versement-transport-interstitiel-destine-aux-regions.html>L'Assemble abroge le versement transport interstitiel destin aux rgions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./projet-de-loi-3ds-lassemblee-adopte-et-modifie-les-disposition-sur-le-logement-et-lurbanisme.html>l'Assemble adopte et modifie les disposition sur le logement et l'urbanisme</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./publication-dun-projet-de-ccag-fournitures-courantes-et-services.html>Publication d'un projet de CCAG fournitures courantes et services</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaSync.
