Since Ballas and his current partner Charli D’Amelio are frontrunners in the competition, let’s take a look at some of his other previous partners and how they ranked.</strong></p><p>Mark Ballas began on Dancing With the Stars on the show’s fifth season in 2007. He remained as part of the cast until his departure in season 25. After nearly five years, the two-time Mirrorball champion returned back to the show and absolutely rocked the house with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Charli D’Amelio</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-all-of-mark-ballas-s-celebrity-partners-on-dancing-with-the-stars>All of Mark Ballas’s Celebrity Partners on Dancing With the Stars</h2><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-sabrina-bryan>1. Sabrina Bryan</h2><p>The iconic Cheetah Girls star was Ballas’s first ever partner on season five of DWTS. They began the season scoring high, but eventually plateaued in after their perfect score in week four. They were eliminated in week six, finishing in seventh overall.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. Kristi Yamaguchi</h2><p>Ballas won his first ever Mirrorball with Olympic Figure Skater, Kristi Yamaguchi in 2008. This pair once again started the competition out scoring high. They earned a few 8’s along the way, but mostly stayed within the 9 to 10 range.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. Kim Kardashian</h2><p>You read that right, Ballas was paired with none other than Kim Kardashian in season seven of DWTS. This team seemed to struggle, to put it lightly. They didn’t earn very high scores and were eliminated by week two.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4. Shawn Johnson</h2><p>Ballas won his second Mirrorball with Olympic Gymnast Shawn Johnson in season eight. Although this pair ultimately won the season, their journey was unlike Ballas’s winning season with Kristi Yamaguchi. Johnson and Ballas’s scores were much more of a slower burn, they didn’t earn their first perfect score until the Semi-Finals.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5. Melissa Joan Hart</h2><p>Sabrina The Teenage Witch star Melissa Joan Hart was partnered with Ballas in season nine. This pair wasn’t given the highest points ever, but they truly battled their way through the season, earning mostly 6’s and 7’s until their Charleston dance. They were eliminated in week six after their points plateaued.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>6. Shannen Doherty</h2><p>Ballas was paired with actress Shannen Doherty on season 10. They were the first couple eliminated in the season.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>7. Bristol Palin</h2><p>Ballas was partners with Bristol Palin not once, but twice. The professional dancer performed with the television personality in season 11 and the spin off, All-Stars. They rightfully earned the third place in their first season together, but was short of redemption on All-Stars, where they placed ninth.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>8. Chelsea Kane</h2><p>Ballas and actress Chelsea Kane took the stage on season 12 and ultimately earned third place. By week six of the competition, the pair began earning 10’s.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>9. Kristin Cavallari</h2><p>In season 13, Ballas was paired with TV personality Kristin Cavallari. Although this pair didn’t score below average, they went home in week three, placing in tenth.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>10. Katherine Jenkins</h2><p>Ballas almost earned his third Mirrorball with singer Katherine Jenkins. They became the pair to beat very early on in the competition, earning their first 10 in week three. Eventually, they finished in third place.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>11. Alexandra Raisman</h2><p>The following year, Ballas made it into the finale once again with Olympic Gymnast Alexandra Raisman. The pair finished in fourth place overall.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>12. Christina Milian</h2><p>In season 17, Ballas was partnered with actress Christina Milian. Although they quickly scored high, they went home during week five, finishing in ninth place.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>13. Candace Cameron Bure</h2><p>Once again, Ballas was super close to winning his third Mirrorball trophy with Full House star <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Candace Cameron Bure</a>. The pair made it all the way to the finale and placed in third after not earning a single perfect score.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>14. Sadie Robertson</h2><p>In the following year, Ballas was once again close to winning his third Mirrorball, but fell short by two places with actress Sadie Robertson. The pair progressed throughout each week of the competition, but ultimately ended in second place.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/VT82e-cu9aE?t=7</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>15. Willow Shields</h2><p>Ballas’s season 20 partner was none other than The Hunger Games star Willow Shields. The pair progressed pretty quickly, but hit their plateau after earning three out of four 10’s in week four. They were eliminated in week seven, placing in seventh.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>16. Alexa PenaVega</h2><p>The following season, Ballas was paired with Spy Kids star Alexa PenaVega. Although this pair improved each week, they were eliminated in week nine, placing in sixth.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>17. Paige VanZant</h2><p>In the following year, Ballas got close to earning his third Mirrorball once again, but fell two places short. Ballas and partner Paige VanZant impressed off the get-go, earning their first <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">perfect score</a> in week seven. They placed in second.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>18. Lindsey Stirling</h2><p>In Ballas’s last season as a full time cast member, he almost won his third Mirrorball trophy, again, with America’s Got Talent alum <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lindsey Stirling</a>. They finished in second place on season 25.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Original_CarrieAnnInaba_LenGoodman_DerekHough_BrunoTonioli_ABC_Raymond-Liu-220x147.jpg alt="Carrie Ann Inaba Warns Remaining ‘DWTS’ Pairs About Inappropriate Lifts" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wp6jnpqinsGqsdJmq6GZpGLEpr7EZqeaoaKasW7DyK2fZqWRp7hursClo5qrXaS7brDWrapmmpWbvLOxjJyfmqqcnnqlrcyeo6KnXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./domina-joelle-wigs-and-hairstyles-mgm-1235689996.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Domina: How Italian Sculptor Antonio Canova Inspired Wigs and Hairstyles in Roman Drama</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./giants-black-cat-football.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Best Memes of the Cat at the Giants/Cowboys Football Game</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1605899-sosoliso-plane-crash-survivor-kechi-dazzles-fans-photoshoot-flaunts-body-pics-year.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./doja-cat.html>Doja Cat (Rapper and Singer-Songwriter)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lassemblee-abroge-le-versement-transport-interstitiel-destine-aux-regions.html>L'Assemble abroge le versement transport interstitiel destin aux rgions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./projet-de-loi-3ds-lassemblee-adopte-et-modifie-les-disposition-sur-le-logement-et-lurbanisme.html>l'Assemble adopte et modifie les disposition sur le logement et l'urbanisme</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./publication-dun-projet-de-ccag-fournitures-courantes-et-services.html>Publication d'un projet de CCAG fournitures courantes et services</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaSync.
