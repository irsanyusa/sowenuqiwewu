My beloved wife of 26 years and mother to our five children left us today after 2 years of living with non-small cell lung cancer,” Troper wrote in the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post</a>. “Susan was not just my best friend and partner in life, but a brilliant mind, a loving mother, and a dear friend to many. Her impact on our family and the world was immeasurable. We are heartbroken, but grateful for the time we had with her. Please keep our family in your thoughts as we navigate this difficult time.”</p><p>Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, in a tribute&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted</a>&nbsp;on X said, “Unbelievably saddened by the loss of my dear friend @SusanWojcicki after two years of living with cancer. She is as core to the history of Google as anyone, and it’s hard to imagine the world without her.” Pichai continued, “She was an incredible person, leader and friend who had a tremendous impact on the world and I’m one of countless Googlers who is better for knowing her. We will miss her dearly. Our thoughts with her family. RIP Susan.”</p><p>Wojcicki joined Google in 1999 as the 16th employee, becoming the search engine’s first marketing exec and going on to become one of the most prominent women leaders in Silicon Valley. Co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin initially ran the company out of her garage in Menlo Park, Calif., which Wojcicki had rented out to the duo before Google secured office space.</p><p>Wojcicki was a vocal advocate for employers to offer generous family benefits, particularly paid maternity leave. In 2015, she was named a&nbsp;<a href=#>Variety&nbsp;Power of Women honoree</a>, highlighting her literacy charity Room to Read. “At YouTube, it’s been an opportunity for me to be able to help other women,”&nbsp;<a href=#>she told&nbsp;Variety&nbsp;</a>at the time. “I see the potential that women have. And I enjoy being a mentor, figuring the best way for them to balance work with family.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Neal Mohan, who succeeded Wojcicki as YouTube CEO, said he’d had “the good fortune of meeting Susan 17 years ago when when she was the architect of the DoubleClick acquisition,” the ad-tech company where he had been an executive. “Her legacy lives on in everything she touched @google and @youtube,” Mohan&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">wrote on X</a>. “I am forever grateful for her friendship and guidance. I will miss her tremendously. My heart goes out to her family and loved ones.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In her multiple roles at Google,&nbsp;Wojcicki had overseen product management of AdSense, Google Book Search and Google Video as well as the syndication of the company’s products.&nbsp;Prior to Google, she worked at Intel, Bain & Co. and R.B. Webber & Co.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Wojcicki was born on July 5, 1968, in Santa Clara, Calif. Her father, Stanley Wojcicki, was a physics professor at Stanford and her mother, Esther Wojcicki, was a teacher. She graduated from Harvard in 1990 with a bachelor’s degree in history and literature before earning a master’s in economics at the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1993. She received an MBA from the UCLA Anderson School of Management in 1998. Wojcicki married Troper, who currently works at Google as a director of product management, on Aug. 23, 1998.</p><h2 id=optional-screen-reader class=lrv-a-screen-reader-only>optional screen reader</h2><h4 class="o-nav__title lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-font-family-secondary o-nav__title a-content-ignore u-line-height-140 u-letter-spacing-0002">Read More About:</h4><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpWPDor7InquyZpOkunB%2Bj2traJyZnLa1rctopZ6vo2TAtr%2FAp2Swp5qYtqS3yGawqK2kqq%2BmecaopqCklWK8o7XTZmhvcGhufA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lgv-tours-bordeaux-la-region-aquitaine-va-financer-une-partie-du-projet.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>la rgion Aquitaine va financer une partie du projet</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./poles-de-competitivite-109-millions-deuros-pour-93-nouveaux-projets-de-recherche-et-developpement.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>109 millions d'euros pour 93 nouveaux projets de recherche et dveloppement</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1605899-sosoliso-plane-crash-survivor-kechi-dazzles-fans-photoshoot-flaunts-body-pics-year.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./doja-cat.html>Doja Cat (Rapper and Singer-Songwriter)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lassemblee-abroge-le-versement-transport-interstitiel-destine-aux-regions.html>L'Assemble abroge le versement transport interstitiel destin aux rgions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./projet-de-loi-3ds-lassemblee-adopte-et-modifie-les-disposition-sur-le-logement-et-lurbanisme.html>l'Assemble adopte et modifie les disposition sur le logement et l'urbanisme</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./publication-dun-projet-de-ccag-fournitures-courantes-et-services.html>Publication d'un projet de CCAG fournitures courantes et services</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaSync.
