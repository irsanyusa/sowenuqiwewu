Some of its biggest talents however, come from the youngest contestants. Age has no limit on skill, and the following acts proved just that. All under 16-years-old, here are the top 10 youngest acts on America’s Got Talent ranked.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-10-the-amazing-shoji>10.

For his audition, <a href=#>The Amazing Shoji </a>demonstrated a series of coin and card tricks. He even used a deck designed by Shin Lim in his act. Impressed by the skill-level of such a young magician, all four judges voted him through to the next round. Unfortunately, he was not selected in the Judge Cuts, and was ultimately eliminated from the competition.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-9-kaitlyn-maher>9.

She received three yeses and made it all the way to the top 10. Throughout her journey, she sang songs like “What a Wonderful World” and “Beauty and the Beast.” She is definitely one of the cutest contestants to ever grace the AGT stage.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-8-quintavious-johnson>8.

Here, he performed Mariah Carey’s “Without You” and even managed to make <a href=#>Simon Cowell</a> a bit emotional. However, he did not receive enough votes to advance to the finals. As a fan favorite, his elimination came with great shock and disappointment.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-6-celine-tam>6.
