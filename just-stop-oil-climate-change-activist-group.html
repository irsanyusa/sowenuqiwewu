border-l-2 border-solid border-time-red text-5xl py-2 pr-0.5 pl-[0.3125rem] my-0.5 mr-2.5 font-zilla-slab">Y</span>ou may have seen the headlines: Tomato soup <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">thrown on Van Gogh’s </a>famous Sunflowers painting, vegan chocolate cake launched in the face of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">King Charles III’s Madame Tussauds wax figure</a> and protesters<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> interrupting a live performance </a>of musical Les Misérables.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">These viral protests were the work of Just Stop Oil, a British activist group opposed to new U.K. fossil fuel projects in order to combat climate change, that has garnered heaps of attention and ignited both praise and criticism in less than two years of activity.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">With the group making headlines in the news again, here’s what you need to know about the climate activist organization.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What is Just Stop Oil and what does the group want?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Just Stop Oil <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">describes itself</a> as a “nonviolent civil resistance group demanding the U.K. Government stop licensing all new oil, gas and coal projects.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">its campaign </a>description and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">public research document</a>, the group claims that extracting new fossil fuels “will kill our children and condemn humanity to oblivion” and human-induced climate change “will destroy human civilisation unless emergency action is taken to rapidly reduce our Greenhouse Gas Emissions to zero in a very short timescale.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The group aims to achieve this by switching U.K. government subsidies for oil and gas industries toward clean energy, public transportation and insulation to reduce energy consumption. It calls on the government to transition to sustainable energy by “creating millions of proper skilled jobs and protecting the rights of workers in sunset industries” or wait for the “unavoidable collapse” of society.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Who is behind the group?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Just Stop Oil is a non-hierarchical coalition of organizers, scientists, lawyers and former oil industry workers who operate in autonomous blocs with no formal leadership, Indigo Rumbelow, a public face of the organization, told<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> The Guardian</a> last year. She said the group was formed in December 2021, although it went public <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in February 2022</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The group’s “adviser,” according to the same article,<a href=#> identified elsewhere as a co-founder</a>, is <a href=#>Roger Hallam</a>. He has said he was an organic farmer in Wales before turning to activism. Hallam also founded <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">similar climate protest group Extinction Rebellion</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Just Stop Oil gets its funding via donations from the public, private individuals and grants. From March to August 2023, the group received 51% of its funding from public donations, 21% from donations over £20,000, 16% from green energy industrialist Dale Vince, 10% from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollywood filmmaker Adam McKay</a> and 2% from the U.S.-based <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Climate Emergency Fund</a>, the group told TIME in an emailed statement on Nov. 11. The group did not provide total numbers in donations received.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Vince, who <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote in The Guardian</a> that he gave the group more than £340,000, announced he was withdrawing his financial support in Oct. 2023, arguing change at the ballot box was more effective than protest and urging people “to vote to save the planet.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Climate Emergency Fund was started with funding from heiress Aileen Getty, the granddaughter of oil tycoon J. Paul Getty, who<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> said in an op-ed for </a><a href=#>The Guardian</a> she was proud to support Just Stop Oil.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">group’s website says it uses</a> its money for recruitment, training, capacity building, education, refreshments, accommodation and travel costs.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What are the group’s most prolific protests to date?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Just Stop Oil <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">set an ultimatum</a> for the U.K. government to meet its demands by March 14, 2022. When the government did not, the group began staging protests and disruptions to call attention to their cause—from<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> climbing on oil tankers </a>to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">interrupting the British Academy Film Awards (BAFTAs</a>) red carpet event.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In some of the most high-profile incidents, two group members were photographed launching chocolate cake at King Charles III's Madame Tussauds wax figure in October 2022. The pair denied criminal charges, but were convicted at trial and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ordered by a judge to pay £3,500</a> ($4,278) as compensation to the museum to repair the figure in January. The group has also repeatedly targeted artwork in museums, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">inspiring similar acts of protest around Europe</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In July 2022, five activists were arrested after <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">super-gluing their hands </a>to the frame of a replica of Leonardo da Vinci’s The Last Supper painting in London’s Royal Academy, with one spray-painting “NO NEW OIL” on the wall.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Last October, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">two people in Just Stop Oil’s bright orange T-shirts </a>opened cans of tomato soup and threw the liquid on to Van Gogh’s Sunflowers painting at the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square before gluing their hands to the wall. The painting was not damaged as it was covered by glass.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Why is Just Stop Oil in the news once again?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On Oct. 4, 2023, Just Stop Oil interrupted a live performance of West End musical Les Misérables, causing for the production to be halted.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On Nov. 6, two protesters were arrested after <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">smashing the glass</a> protecting the 1600s-era Rokeby Venus painting by Diego Velazquez at the National Gallery. The same painting was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">slashed by suffragette Mary Richardson</a> in 1914 in protest.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the most recent controversial incident on Nov. 8, protesters <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">laid down on Waterloo Bridge in London</a>. Police <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">accused the group’s protest</a> of causing a traffic jam that impeded an ambulance with blue lights on. The ambulance driver <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told The Telegraph </a>he was responding to a “life or death emergency” and pleaded with police to let him through.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In posts on X (formerly Twitter), Just Stop Oil <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">accused police of blocking the ambulance</a>. In another <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">post</a> and an emailed statement to TIME, the group said its policy is to move to let ambulances with blue lights through but added that “nevertheless, we accept that our actions do cause disruption.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“There are a limited range of options available to ordinary people to resist government criminality,” the statement read.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The group said it was too soon for freedom of information requests to show whether there were ambulance delays in this incident, but<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> pointed to past requests,</a> where the group was similarly accused, but they say no <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ambulance</a> delays were shown.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The group<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> said on its website</a> that it tracked more than 300 arrests of its members from Oct. 30 to Nov. 11 amid a string of protests.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In an update shared on Nov. 8, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">police said</a> they’d made 219 arrests and charged 98 activists during that time period. "Ultimately it is Londoners who are bearing the brunt and cost of Just Stop Oil’s disruption," the Metropolitan Police wrote.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Just Stop Oil is also in the midst of planning a "People vs. Oil" protest march in London on Nov. 18. "<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Everyone is invited</a>—come send a clear message that we won't stand for new oil and gas," the group posted on X.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Are the group’s actions having an impact?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The U.K. government has moved in the opposite direction of Just Stop Oil’s goal—to halt the licensing of new British fossil fuel facilities—since the climate activist group began.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Under Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, the U.K. government <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">has said it will license new oil and gas drilling</a> in the North Sea, which was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">affirmed in the King’s Speech</a>, the monarch’s annual address to the British Parliament, on Nov. 7.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sunak’s government said that the move was to ensure British energy independence, especially when the country saw prices skyrocket during the Ukraine war because of its dependence on Russian energy sources.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">To try to assuage climate concerns, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">government said</a> that each annual licensing round will only take place if key tests are met supporting the transition to net zero emissions. Sunak’s government <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">had already watered down policies</a> and pushed back some deadlines to get the country to net zero.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">However, change may well be on the horizon. Sunak’s Conservative Party, which cycled through two other prime ministers in a chaotic 2022, has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">suffered defeats in local elections</a> and could <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">struggle in the general election</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Keir Starmer, the head of the Labour Party, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">had said in June </a>that he would stop new licensing for oil and gas fields if in power, but<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> in August </a>he clarified he would not end existing or promised licenses to ensure a managed energy transition and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">called Just Stop Oil’s demands “contemptible.”</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When asked whether the group’s actions have had an impact, or what it would take to do so, Just Stop Oil claimed in its emailed statement that with the exception of the Conservatives, its demand is supported by major British political parties, the U.N. and other international bodies. “We have no doubt that we will win,” the group said. “It is a matter of when, not if.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZva2NpfXh%2BjqOsrKxdqMGwvIyooKVlk6G2rq3TnmScoJGjtKZ5wJyroq6ZqMFus9GorKln</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./la-cour-des-comptes-veut-trancher-dans-les-aides-personnelles-au-logement.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>La Cour des comptes veut trancher dans les aides personnelles au logement</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./i-tried-flintts-mouth-watering-mints-for-oral-sex-and-theyre-a-game-changer.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>I Tried Flintts Mouth Watering Mints for Oral Sex, and They're a Game-Changer</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1605899-sosoliso-plane-crash-survivor-kechi-dazzles-fans-photoshoot-flaunts-body-pics-year.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./doja-cat.html>Doja Cat (Rapper and Singer-Songwriter)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lassemblee-abroge-le-versement-transport-interstitiel-destine-aux-regions.html>L'Assemble abroge le versement transport interstitiel destin aux rgions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./projet-de-loi-3ds-lassemblee-adopte-et-modifie-les-disposition-sur-le-logement-et-lurbanisme.html>l'Assemble adopte et modifie les disposition sur le logement et l'urbanisme</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./publication-dun-projet-de-ccag-fournitures-courantes-et-services.html>Publication d'un projet de CCAG fournitures courantes et services</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaSync.
