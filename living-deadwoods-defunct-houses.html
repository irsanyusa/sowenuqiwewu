Dak. (pop. 1,974), has long been a pretty lively town. For more than 100 years it has sported some of the best little whorehouses in the West. Their combined commerce has, in fact, rivaled logging, mining and tourism as Deadwood’s chief source of income. No longer. The bordellos have been closed down, and not all Deadwoodians are happy about it.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Pam’s Frontier Room, Dixie’s Shasta Room, the Pine Room and the Cozy Room were raided by a task force worthy of an Abscam sting: the FBI, U.S. marshals, the South Dakota division of criminal investigation, the South Dakota Attorney General’s office and the Lawrence County sheriffs office. After state officials filed public-nuisance charges against the bordellos, 27 girls and their three poodles were taken into custody as material witnesses in a federal grand jury probe. They were released and have not been seen since. A lot of people miss them.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">According to a survey by the Lead (S. Dak.) Daily Call, 42% of the locals were in favor of leaving the houses open, vs. 35% supporting their closure. Some 40 proponents of licensed lust even held a parade on Main Street to support les girls. Sportin’ house advocates point out that the ladies kept to their quarters and had regular medical checkups. “They sure kept a lot of strange men off the streets,” says Gayle Williams, a barmaid at Saloon Number 10. They also contributed to local charities, as well as such causes as the Jaycees and the Little League. Moreover, many of the hunters who flock to Deadwood purportedly to bag antelope, moose and elk in the Black Hills were said actually to have spent their time stalking Venus. Said one resident: “This is gonna kill the hell out of the hunting season.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Opponents of the bordellos point out that, for all their do-gooding, they did not pay Deadwood’s 1% sales tax. Thomas Blair, an anesthetist who helped form a committee to support the anti-whorehouse drive, quotes reports that some of the houses made at least $5,000 a week. Their winked-at illegality was an affront to law-abiding citizens, he says, adding: “I’m not going to legislate my morality on someone else, but I don’t want anyone legislating their immorality on me.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Last week Pam Holliday, who once greeted patrons at the door of Pam’s Frontier Room, was busily auctioning off its furnishings. “I have very expensive lawyers,” she explained. A witty redhead who can barely raise her left hand under the weight of diamond and emerald rings, Pam insists that she taught her girls all the social graces: “You might say it was a type of charm school.” Buyers, many of them female, came from miles around to buy Pamorabilia and get her autograph (price: $2). Among the hottest items at the auction: oven timers, an electric vibrator pillow and a crushed-velvet tiger-striped bedspread with matching curtains. The sale netted several thousand dollars.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As for the future, Pam predicts that ordinary prostitutes will soon replace the banished charm-school graduates. “Are there going to be hookers in Deadwood?” she asks. “You better believe it. We’re going to be loaded with them.” ∎</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9vbm1pbX5wuMivoKefXZmyorDWqKadq12ZsqfBzZyrZqCfqsCmv44%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1577298-super-eagles-legend-jj-okocha-dances-shows-football-moves-features-flavours-agba-baller.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Super Eagles Legend JJ Okocha Dances, Shows Football Moves As He Features in Flavours Agba Bal</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1404750-larry-birkhead-biography-age-net-worth-occupation-partner-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Larry Birkhead's biography: age, net worth, occupation, partner</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1605899-sosoliso-plane-crash-survivor-kechi-dazzles-fans-photoshoot-flaunts-body-pics-year.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./doja-cat.html>Doja Cat (Rapper and Singer-Songwriter)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lassemblee-abroge-le-versement-transport-interstitiel-destine-aux-regions.html>L'Assemble abroge le versement transport interstitiel destin aux rgions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./projet-de-loi-3ds-lassemblee-adopte-et-modifie-les-disposition-sur-le-logement-et-lurbanisme.html>l'Assemble adopte et modifie les disposition sur le logement et l'urbanisme</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./publication-dun-projet-de-ccag-fournitures-courantes-et-services.html>Publication d'un projet de CCAG fournitures courantes et services</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaSync.
