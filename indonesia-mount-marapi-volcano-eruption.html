Bodies of all the victims have been found, though not yet all identified, local authorities confirmed Wednesday, after the last missing climber was located a few yards away from the eruption site.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Video footage showed plumes of ash spluttering 9,800 ft. into the air around Mount Marapi—one of the nation’s 127 active volcanoes—over the weekend. Seventy-five hikers were in the vicinity when the 9,485 ft. volcano erupted.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Initially, 49 people were evacuated to shelter, and rescuers evacuated another three survivors found near the crater later on Monday.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Some suffered from burns because it was very hot, and they have been taken to the hospital,” Rudy Rinaldi, head of the West Sumatra Disaster Mitigation Agency, told <a href=#>Agence France-Presse</a> of the rescued hikers. “Those who are injured were the ones who got closer to the crater.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Ten climbers remained missing</a> as of Tuesday but were presumed dead because of their proximity to the eruption, West Sumatra deputy police chief Edi Mardianto said. By Wednesday, West Sumatra police chief Suharyono told reporters, 20 bodies had been taken to hospital for identification. As of Tuesday evening, only 11 of the dead <a href=#>had been identified</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Efforts to retrieve bodies have been hampered amid continuous eruptions. “Marapi is still very much active. We can’t see the height of the column because it’s covered by the cloud,” Ahmad Rifandi, the head of a monitoring station at the volcano, told <a href=#>AFP</a> on Tuesday, adding that there were five eruptions from midnight to 8 a.m. local time.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The mother of Zhafirah Zahrim Febrina, a hiker who is receiving treatment in hospital, told AFP her daughter has incurred “tremendous trauma.” Rani Radelani, 39, said: “She is affected psychologically because she saw her burns, and she also had to endure the pain all night.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Efforts to locate remaining missing hikers were paused on Monday following another smaller eruption. “It’s too dangerous if we continue searching now,” said Jodi Haryawan, a spokesman for the search and rescue team. Local residents are forbidden from going within 3 km (1.86 mi.) of the crater, and officials have confirmed that climbing routes have been closed.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Since 2011, the volcano has been placed on the third highest alert level on a four-level scale. But officials raised it to the second highest alert level in the aftermath of Sunday’s eruption.&nbsp; Hikers were prohibited from attempting to reach the peak, but according to Hendra Gunawan, the head of the Center for Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation, some hikers “broke the rules to fulfill their satisfaction to climb further.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Marapi’s last eruption, which took place in April 1979, was its deadliest, having killed 60 people.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sumatra is part of Indonesia’s archipelago, located on the Pacific Ocean’s “Ring of Fire,” where tectonic plates can converge and invite high volcanic and seismic activity. <a href=#>National Geographic</a> notes that around 90% of all earthquakes take place along the ring, while 75% of the earth’s active volcanoes are located in the region.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZva2Rnf3GEjqKlnaeemsCqrYympq6mpGK6or7AqaBmrp%2BhsKK6zmacq62gqbawuo4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./a-hill-in-korea-1200418115.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>A Hill in Korea</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1530734-100-questions-girlfriend-closer-her.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>100+ best questions to ask your girlfriend to get closer to her</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1605899-sosoliso-plane-crash-survivor-kechi-dazzles-fans-photoshoot-flaunts-body-pics-year.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./doja-cat.html>Doja Cat (Rapper and Singer-Songwriter)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lassemblee-abroge-le-versement-transport-interstitiel-destine-aux-regions.html>L'Assemble abroge le versement transport interstitiel destin aux rgions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./projet-de-loi-3ds-lassemblee-adopte-et-modifie-les-disposition-sur-le-logement-et-lurbanisme.html>l'Assemble adopte et modifie les disposition sur le logement et l'urbanisme</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./publication-dun-projet-de-ccag-fournitures-courantes-et-services.html>Publication d'un projet de CCAG fournitures courantes et services</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaSync.
