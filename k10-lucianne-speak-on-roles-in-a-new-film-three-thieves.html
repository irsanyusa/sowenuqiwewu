It was fun shooting it from beginning to end. From the story itself to the cast and even the crew, everybody was just crazy,” K10 said at the commencement of the interview.</p><p>For Lucianne, a newbie in Nollywood, she said, “The set was the most entertaining two months of my life to be like when I got the script, I couldn't stop laughing. Being on set with this one (K10) is just mad anyway. The whole of everyone was just crazy. We laughed all through. And it just made it easy for the story to come to life. It was just hilarious. It was just too funny to find me. So yeah, definitely need to watch it.”</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-3c2c38b2-7c44-4897-aae0-ca710883239c data-caption="Lucianne and Koye K10 Kekere Ekun both agreed that 'Three Thieves' script was as hilarious as filming.

That's the first thing, that there's no way this movie is going to be made, and I won't be a part of it. So that was it. I think it was the point I fell off my bed laughing. And I'm a comedy person. So I just had to be a part of it.”</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Lucianne, a singer and actress said it was almost impossible for her not to bring her character alive as the script demanded. She said, “For me, the script was so well written that it would be difficult for you to play the character and it not be funny. Because of the way it was written. It was like gold handed to you. I mean, so it was, it's almost impossible for you to not bring the character to life. So that never crossed my mind, I was just always excited to get behind the camera to start working with everyone because I just knew it was going to be a hit.”</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-8540dac7-19ab-4f08-a63f-304641bd2849 data-caption="Lucianne Ukpabi says it was fun learning and acclimatising into Nollywood while filming on the set of 'Three Thieves'.

And if you don't, what I guarantee you is that you’ll have a good time. You will enjoy yourself. It is not only comedy but one that is slightly different from the way we typically do comedy in Nollywood,” he said.</p><p>Lucciane ended the chat saying, “The ‘Three Thieves’ is on par. And it competes with a couple of movies that I've seen in the UK that's homegrown in the UK. So if you want to see something that will make you proud of Nigeria, that will make you laugh and be willing to tell your people this is a homegrown movie, this is the one to see.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6mpq%2Bhlah8rH2PZqOum5mWu6%2BxjKynnpmbYryvedGoo56rXZ67bq2Mp5ywZZaeua5506Gpnp1dqbWqsdWeqmianWeAernP</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./std-sensitive-condoms.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>STD Condoms: Teens Propose New Version to Detect Diseases</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./28266-how-much-problem-humans-kissing-dogs.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How much of a issue is humans kissing dogs?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1605899-sosoliso-plane-crash-survivor-kechi-dazzles-fans-photoshoot-flaunts-body-pics-year.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./doja-cat.html>Doja Cat (Rapper and Singer-Songwriter)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lassemblee-abroge-le-versement-transport-interstitiel-destine-aux-regions.html>L'Assemble abroge le versement transport interstitiel destin aux rgions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./projet-de-loi-3ds-lassemblee-adopte-et-modifie-les-disposition-sur-le-logement-et-lurbanisme.html>l'Assemble adopte et modifie les disposition sur le logement et l'urbanisme</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./publication-dun-projet-de-ccag-fournitures-courantes-et-services.html>Publication d'un projet de CCAG fournitures courantes et services</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaSync.
