I’ve looked for different scents, levels, mousse, lotions, oils, gradual build tanners, mild glow tanners—the list literally goes on and on. Over the years I’ve personally tried so many different kinds, and I can tell you ones that had people fooled, asking where I just came back from vacation. I’m lucky enough to have very honest, loving people in my life who want me to look my best, so if I look orange, they’re going to tell me without hesitation…and they did.</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-best-self-tanners>Our top picks for best self tanners</h2><h3>Best self tanner for beginners: <a rel=nofollow href=#>St. Tropez Self Tan Bronzing Mousse</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best self tanner for beginners</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.thcdn.com/images/large/webp//productimg/1600/1600/12928505-9264848490974027.jpg alt="St. Tropez Self Tan Bronzing Mousse" title="St. Tropez Self Tan Bronzing Mousse" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>St. Tropez Self Tan Bronzing Mousse</h3></p><p>The St. Tropez Self Tan Bronzing Mousse has been a long time favorite of mine ever since my friend and I, who is also quite pale, came back from the Bahamas. She and I took a cruise back in college and it ended up storming the entire time and we barely got any time in the sun. When we came back, we rubbed this all over our bodies and people thought we had a wonderful time and got our “natural glow” from the Bahamian sun. It has a really smooth texture that goes on even and gives you a noticeable bronze boost with one layer. In addition to it easily being my favorite, it’s also on the less expensive side compared to some other brands at just $18.</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.thcdn.com/images/large/webp//productimg/1600/1600/12928505-9264848490974027.jpg></span></span><p>JESSICA KELLY</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Formula: Mousse</li><li>Shades: Classic</li><li>Longevity: Generally between 4-10 days</li><li>Size: 50 ml, 120 ml, 240 ml</li><li>Price on publish: $18 for 50ml</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Goes on smooth and even</li><li>Inexpensive</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Slight yellow/orange tone that simmers down after the first shower</li></ul><h3>The bottom line:</h3><p>If you want to try a self tanner, but don’t know where to start, this is a fan favorite at a lower price point.</p><h3>Best self tanner for a dark tan and best-smelling self tanner: <a rel=nofollow href=#>St.Tropez Self Tan Suprême Violet Mousse</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best self tanner for a dark tan and best-smelling self tanner</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s2759249-main-zoom.jpg alt="St. Tropez Self Tan Suprême Violet Mousse 4.6 oz / 200 ml" title="St. Tropez Self Tan Suprême Violet Mousse 4.6 oz / 200 ml" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>St. Tropez Self Tan Suprême Violet Mousse 4.6 oz / 200 ml</h3></p><p>It’s quite unusual to find a good smelling self tanner and this one actually smells incredible. There’s no self tanner chemical odor—instead, it has a light floral-berry scent. A little goes a very long way with this one because it leaves a really rich, deep tan almost similar to a kalamata olive tone. (And yes, it does have a violet hue—this is said to help even out the undertones of the tan, helping to minimize any orange effects.) Go easy with this one, a little goes a long way. You can always add on another layer later if it’s not as dark as you want it. Tip: The brand recommends leaving this on for as little as 30 minutes for a hint of glow or up to 8 hours before showering if you want to achieve the olive/dark tan result.</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/e13092e7cbeeff4c6df0ee0bce7de615/92de0/st.jpg></span></span><p>JESSICA KELLY</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Formula: Mousse</li><li>Shades: Normal</li><li>Longevity: Generally between 4-10 days</li><li>Size: 200 ml</li><li>Price on publish: $48</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Long lasting</li><li>Natural glow</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Very dark—might not work for very pale skin tones</li></ul><h3>The bottom line:</h3><p>Although this is a good place to start for beginners, it is a dark tan, so make sure you start with a little bit.</p><h3>Best affordable self tanner: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Tanologist Daily Glow — Hydrating Gradual Tanning Lotion</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best affordable self tanner</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Tanologist Daily Glow - Hydrating Gradual Tanning Lotion</h3></p><p>If you’re looking for an affordable self tanner, the Tanologist Daily Glow is only $13.99. There’s a subtle glow up with one layer applied, and it actually smells good, similar to a sweet vanilla scent. In addition to it being a quality product at a really low price point, it’s vegan and cruelty-free. The lightweight formula feels moisturizing, though the lack of tint to the formula can make it tricky to know just where you’ve applied it. However, the buildable formulation does reduce the streak factor, so if you do miss a spot, it’s easy to correct.</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s2759249-main-zoom.jpg></span></span><p>JESSICA KELLY</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Formula: Lotion</li><li>Shades: Fair to medium, medium to dark</li><li>Longevity: Generally between 4-6 days</li><li>Size: 250 ml</li><li>Price on publish: $13.99</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Inexpensive</li><li>Different shade levels</li><li>Nice smell</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Subtle but still noticeable change that might not work if you’re looking for an instant, dark tan</li></ul><h3>The bottom line:</h3><p>For a very affordable self tanner, this one is only $13.99, and gives skin that natural glow.</p><h3>Best luxury self tanner: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Sisley Paris Self Tanning Hydrating Facial Skin Care</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best luxury self tanner</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Self Tanning Hydrating Facial Skin Care</h3></p><p>Sisley has a great reputation using clean ingredients like hibiscus flower and sesame extract.

We live in a world of wanting instant gratification, so I fully understand the urge to do that, but if you’re pale, go for a light/mild shade first. You’ll have a much more natural look and you can always layer on more if you feel like it’s not quite dark enough.</p><h3>Are you sensitive to any ingredients?</h3><p>Pay close attention to what’s in the product. You can always ask your dermatologist if you have any specific questions or do a patch test (or both) before rubbing it all over your face or body.</p><h3>What are you willing to spend on the product?</h3><p>Believe it or not, self tanners can go up to the triple digit price range. And, since you have to reapply regularly (once your tan fades), you will go through the product quicker. Like tinted moisturizers and tinted sunscreens, you may want to spend slightly more for a face-specific formulation (especially if it's from a brand you trust already) to avoid potential breakouts or irritation, but keep in mind that the cost can easily snowball.</p><h2 id=how-to-prep-your-skin-and-apply-self-tanner>How to prep your skin and apply self-tanner</h2><p>The experts at the <a rel=nofollow href=#>American Academy of Dermatology</a> recommend exfoliating and drying your skin off first, followed by applying the tanner in sections and washing your hands after each application, being careful to blend the product very well at your ankles and wrists. I personally also recommend moisturizing before putting any tanner on. This tends to make it go on smoother, and I also use a glove to avoid my fingers being blotchy and orange.</p><p>Side note: I have a friend that used to do competitive dancing, and the women always applied self tanner and makeup before shows, so they didn’t look washed out on stage. That friend told me that the best way to remove blotches from your hands after applying is to wash your hands with soap and water, and then wash your hands with toothpaste, as well, as an extra trick.</p><h2 id=how-long-do-self-tanners-last>How long do self tanners last</h2><p>It really depends on the particular tanner, but most self tanners tend to last about a week (5 to 7 days).</p><h2 id=how-do-self-tanners-work>How do self tanners work</h2><p>According to the <a rel=nofollow href=#>National Institutes of Health</a>, self tanners generally stain the skin, using dihydroxyacetone (DHA).</p><h2 id=how-to-make-your-self-tan-last-longer>How to make your self-tan last longer</h2><p>Following the steps above on how to exfoliate and prep the skin before applying the tanner should help it last a little longer. It also helps to avoid exfoliating after you apply it and to not take any baths or soak in any hot tubs. For more specific advice, make sure to follow the suggestions on the product you choose.</p><h2 id=how-i-chose-the-best-self-tanners>How I chose the best self tanners</h2><h3>Testing</h3><p>Although I have tested and tried out the majority of these tanners through the years, I collected them all to do trial patch testing before approving them for the list.</p><h3>Ratings and reviews</h3><p>I looked at ratings from other users and made sure that other people enjoyed the products too. I also made sure they were a fair price for the product.</p><h3>Natural look</h3><p>Just like quality <a rel=alternate href=#>eye creams</a>, so you don’t have to hide behind your <a rel=alternate href=#>sunglasses</a>, a natural glow can give you a little confidence boost. For the products on the list, it was important to me that they provided a tan that looked as natural as possible.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Do self tanners expire?</h3><p>Always check the product itself, but generally yes, self tan products typically expire within six months to a year. This usually has to do with the strength of the dihydroxyacetone weakening over time.</p><h3>What self tanners are safe during pregnancy?</h3><p>I’m not a doctor, so when it comes to anything to do with pregnancy and what is safe for your baby, you should always check with your physician first and foremost. Second to that, you should check the label or speak to the manufacturer of the specific product. For the most part, <a rel=nofollow href=#>fake tanner lotions</a> should be okay to use during pregnancy because the active ingredients are not absorbed beyond the outermost layer of skin, but again, always check with your doctor first.</p><h3>Why do self tanners smell bad?</h3><p>Some smell a little better than others, although I noticed for the most part, the ones that smell great don’t seem to work as well. Fake tanners tend to have that specific smell that isn’t a very pleasant odor, until you’re able to shower the next day. That smell generally comes from the chemical reaction that occurs when the <a rel=nofollow href=#>dihydroxyacetone</a> comes into contact with the skin.</p><h3>What do the Kardashians use for self tanner?</h3><p>The <a rel=nofollow href=#>Kardashians</a> stand behind St. Tropez products, with one of Kim’s favorites being the Jumbo Self Tan Express Mousse.</p><h3>Which is better: Tanning drops or mousse?</h3><p>Personally, I’ve tried both and I prefer the mousse. I like that I can see where it’s being applied, and get that instant gratification. The drops tend to give you a more even, smooth tan, but it doesn’t show up right away, which I don’t always love.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lo5q5p3nTmqWnnaKofA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mrbeast-accusations-explained.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Breaking Down Allegations Against MrBeast and His Company</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./america-learn-biden-mccains-friendship.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What America Should Learn from Biden and McCain's Friendship</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1605899-sosoliso-plane-crash-survivor-kechi-dazzles-fans-photoshoot-flaunts-body-pics-year.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./doja-cat.html>Doja Cat (Rapper and Singer-Songwriter)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lassemblee-abroge-le-versement-transport-interstitiel-destine-aux-regions.html>L'Assemble abroge le versement transport interstitiel destin aux rgions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./projet-de-loi-3ds-lassemblee-adopte-et-modifie-les-disposition-sur-le-logement-et-lurbanisme.html>l'Assemble adopte et modifie les disposition sur le logement et l'urbanisme</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./publication-dun-projet-de-ccag-fournitures-courantes-et-services.html>Publication d'un projet de CCAG fournitures courantes et services</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaSync.
