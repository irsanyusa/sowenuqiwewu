Almost every Instagram user has taken a screengrab of a story at least once.</p><p class=align-left>The feature that makes Instagram stories different from regular posts is that they disappear after 24 hours. People can use IG stories to share things that they want their followers to see, but that they do not want to leave on the internet for too long.</p><p class=align-left>But what happens if you love a story so much you want to save it to view later? You take a screenshot, of course.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b646bbdd58d6397e.jpg><p class=align-left>Before the notification feature was discontinued in June 2018, there was a way people on IG could see who took screengrabs of their stories. The first thing to do was to click on your story to see who viewed it.</p><p class=align-left>Next, you looked out for a swirling star-like symbol.

The answer to this is no. In June 2018, Instagram took down the screenshot alert feature on the app.</p><p class=align-left>People can no longer see when other users take screenshots of their stories on the app. You can go ahead and grab as many IG stories as you want.</p><p class=align-left>Can you see if someone screenshots your Instagram story? Just like other users can not see when you screengrab their stories, you can not see if and when other people take a screen capture of your stories.</p><p class=align-left>To conclude, as of July 2020, no one will know if you screengrab anyone's Insta story. You can take as many shots as you like.</p><h2>Does Instagram notify when you screenshot a DM?</h2><p class=align-left>The social media app does not send notifications for screenshots of texts and images sent as direct messages.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/163da737b804b89f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>An easy guideline on how to hide birthday on Facebook</span></p></a><p class=align-left>However, if an IG user sends you a photo taken using the DM camera on the app, and you take a screenshot of it, IG will let the user know that you have taken a screengrab of their content.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/138b4c6c91ae2a15.jpg><p class=align-left>Generally, IG notifies users when their direct messages have been delivered and seen.

No. The photo and video sharing app does not notify users when other people screengrab their posts on the platform, even if the affected accounts are business accounts or verified accounts.</p><p class=align-left>But, if you take a screenshot of an image taken using the DM camera in the app, Instagram will notify the owner.</p><p class=align-left>Often times, lots of people who create original contents on the app sometimes look for third-party apps that can send them notifications when screenshots of their contents are taken.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1fbd8340827a0506.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to watch deleted YouTube videos: the most effective methods</span></p></a><p class=align-left>These are often fake, and it is not advisable for IG users to give them access to their accounts.</p><p class=align-left>With so much great content being shared on Instagram, it is not surprising that people want to take screengrabs of content on the app. Even though this is totally allowed, you should know that there are other ways you can keep the contents you like or those that you would like to view more than once on the app.</p><p class=align-left>Firstly, you can save content in your 'Saved' folder in the app in order to view them later.
