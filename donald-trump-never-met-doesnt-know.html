One thing it doesn’t: that they literally have never met.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On multiple occasions over the last few years, the president has plainly stated that he doesn’t know someone, has never met them or doesn’t even know who they are — even when he clearly does.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">One example came at a <a href=# rel=noopener>press conference</a> in November of 2018, when he was asked about the rapper Lil Jon, who said that Trump had once <a href=# rel=noopener>called him an “Uncle Tom.”</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I don’t know who Lil Jon is. I don’t — I really don’t,” Trump replied.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But Trump not only knows who the rapper is, he knows him personally. Lil Jon was a <a href=# rel=noopener>two-time contestant</a> on “The Celebrity Apprentice.” Trump has referred to him in the past as an “amazing and wonderful guy,” a “terrific guy” and a “great friend.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Thanks <a href=#>@LilJon</a> for coming to my defense in Rolling Stone Magazine. As I have often said, you are a terrific guy!</p>— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href=#>July 22, 2014</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In that case, Trump was claiming he didn’t know someone who had accusing him of poor behavior. He used a similar defense against a former Trump Tower receptionist who said that Trump once kissed her <a href=# rel=noopener>“directly on the mouth”</a> against her will during an introductory meeting. Trump responded that <a href=# rel=noopener>he didn’t know her and had never met her</a>.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>A woman I don’t know and, to the best of my knowledge, never met, is on the FRONT PAGE of the Fake News Washington Post saying I kissed her (for two minutes yet) in the lobby of Trump Tower 12 years ago. Never happened! Who would do this in a public space with live security......</p>— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href=#>February 20, 2018</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And he used the line when defending himself after mocking a New York Times reporter at a 2015 campaign rally, claiming that his curled-up hands and shaking on stage were not a reference to the reporter’s disability since he doesn’t know him or “what he looks like.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>The reporter who pulled-back from his 14 year old never retracted story is having fun. I don't know what he looks like and don't know him!</p>— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href=#>November 28, 2015</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But Trump also uses the same line against his critics, as a way of arguing that they don’t know what they’re talking about. That was the case with George Conway, the husband of one of his top aides. “I barely know him,” Trump said on Twitter. He later retweeted his campaign manager claiming that “POTUS doesn’t even know him!”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>George Conway, often referred to as Mr. Kellyanne Conway by those who know him, is VERY jealous of his wife’s success & angry that I, with her help, didn’t give him the job he so desperately wanted. I barely know him but just take a look, a stone cold LOSER & husband from hell!</p>— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href=#>March 20, 2019</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Washington Post later <a href=# rel=noopener>published a 2006 letter from Trump</a> in which he thanked Conway for his help on a problem in one of his buildings, adding in a postscript “you have a truly great voice, certainly not a bad asset for a top trial lawyer!”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Trump has also used the line against critics that he really doesn’t know, including former Defense Secretary <a href=# rel=noopener>Robert Gates</a> and retired Marine Gen. <a href=# rel=noopener>John Allen</a>.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I never met former Defense Secretary Robert Gates. He knows nothing about me. But look at the results under his guidance - a total disaster!</p>— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href=#>September 17, 2016</a><p lang=en dir=ltr>General John Allen, who I never met but spoke against me last night, failed badly in his fight against ISIS. His record = BAD <a href=#>#NeverHillary</a></p>— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href=#>July 29, 2016</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s also a way for Trump to diminish someone as unimportant, since he presumes they would have met if they were. That was the case when he attacked Democratic Sen. Bob Casey during a 2018 campaign rally for his Republican opponent.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I’m not sure I ever met Bob Casey, I never met him,” Trump told the audience at a Pennsylvania arena. Then, he added: “And I’m sure I did, I shook his hand. His father was a good man, a totally different person. I don’t think, I don’t know this man. He’s a senator, there’s 100 senators, I don’t know him.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A Philadelphia TV station then <a href=# rel=noopener>dug up a photo and transcript</a> of Casey and Trump at a meeting in the Cabinet Room of the White House talking about proposed tariffs on imported steel earlier that year. A spokesman for Casey’s campaign cited three other interactions in previous months as well.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Trump has also used the line to distance himself from people when a relationship might be problematic, as he did when former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos got into legal trouble.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I don’t know him. I saw him sitting, in one picture, at a table with me. That’s the — that’s the only thing I know about him,” he said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But Trump had previously cited Papadopolous as a member of his foreign policy team—”an energy and oil consultant, excellent guy,” he said <a href=# rel=noopener>an interview with the Washington Post — </a>and once tweeted a photo of a meeting in which Papadopoulos sat near him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/guilty-plea-offers-picture-attempted-collusion.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Trump even used the line against his own acting attorney general — <a href=# rel=noopener>“I don’t know Matt Whitaker”</a> — contradicting what he had said a month earlier on Fox News — <a href=# rel=noopener>“I mean, I know Matt Whitaker.”</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He did the same with WikiLeaks, the website that worked with Russian intelligence to publicize stolen Hillary Clinton emails. During the 2016 campaign, Trump regularly brought up WikiLeaks, saying at one rally <a href=# rel=noopener>“I love WikiLeaks.”</a> But when WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was arrested in London, Trump took the opposite tack.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I know nothing about WikiLeaks,” <a href=# rel=noopener>he told reporters</a>. “It’s not my thing.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Trump made a similar about-face with Russian president Vladimir Putin. From 2015 to 2016 he <a href=# rel=noopener>went from saying</a> that he has “a relationship” with Putin, that Putin once gave him a present, that he’s spoken with him and “got to know him very well,” to saying “I don’t know who Putin is,” “I have no relationship with Putin” and “I don’t know Putin.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Trump, as the saying goes, has “never met” a person he doesn’t like.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZubWhnhHV9jp2mp5mcmXq1vtSmp2amlauys3nMnqtmnJ%2BawK%2FAjKSlqK9f</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./efficacite-energetique-industrielle-enjeux-leviers.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Efficacit nergtique industrielle : enjeux &amp;amp; leviers</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./plan-de-renovation-energetique-des-batiments-des-propositions-pour-ne-pas-aller-droit-dans-le-mur.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>des propositions pour ne pas aller droit dans le mur</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1605899-sosoliso-plane-crash-survivor-kechi-dazzles-fans-photoshoot-flaunts-body-pics-year.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./doja-cat.html>Doja Cat (Rapper and Singer-Songwriter)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lassemblee-abroge-le-versement-transport-interstitiel-destine-aux-regions.html>L'Assemble abroge le versement transport interstitiel destin aux rgions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./projet-de-loi-3ds-lassemblee-adopte-et-modifie-les-disposition-sur-le-logement-et-lurbanisme.html>l'Assemble adopte et modifie les disposition sur le logement et l'urbanisme</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./publication-dun-projet-de-ccag-fournitures-courantes-et-services.html>Publication d'un projet de CCAG fournitures courantes et services</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaSync.
