After two years in the reformatory, Barbara married, became a “sea gull,” i.e., a fleet follower in San Diego. She was convicted of perjury, prostitution, lewd conduct, vagrancy; she had four husbands, three sons. In 1953 she was arrested in a room with Emmett Perkins and Jack Santo, who were suspects in six murder cases. Barbara had a narcotic user’s scars on her arms and a new charge on her record: murder. A witness testified he saw her pistol-whip a crippled widow to death. Barbara, Santo and Perkins were convicted, and Barbara became the third woman in California to be sentenced to death.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In prison Barbara showed an above-average I.Q. of 114, began listening’ to classical music, read Socrates and was quoted: “I’ve always been a pushover for poetry—Oscar Wilde. Walt Whitman and some of Robert Bridges. Verse seems to say something to me that nothing else can.” When the “sea gull” was arrested, she had a mask of caked make-up and a bottle-blond hairdo, but as she was moved to the death house at San Quentin 26 months later, she had neat brown hair, a scrubbed face, wore a tasteful beige suit and looked like a respectable suburban housewife.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">One morning last week she toyed with the hot fudge sundae she had ordered for breakfast. The gas chamber execution was scheduled for 10 a.m. At 9:05 the governor’s office called and postponed the execution because the State Supreme Court had been asked by Barbara’s lawyer to hear a new argument. At 10:26 a.m. Governor Goodwin Knight himself called, said the court had rejected the request. A remote-reading stethoscope was being taped over Barbara Graham’s heart when a third call came at 10:43, delaying the execution. A new petition had been filed. Cried Barbara: “Why do they torture me? I was ready at 10 o’clock.” At 11:12 the phone rang once more; the court had rejected the last plea. At 11:31 Barbara entered the chamber; at 11:34 the cyanide pellets were dropped in the acid. Barbara held her breath, tilted her head back as if praying; at 11:37½ she breathed and died, aged 32.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9ucnBpa4Zwr9GipJ5llJqutbSMqJ1mmV2osqJ5xq6jpWc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./deconfinement-des-ouvertures-encore-tres-encadrees.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>des ouvertures encore trs encadres</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kaitlyn-dever-unbelievable-netflix-1234693159.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why Kaitlyn Dever Was the Perfect Actor to Portray the Truth Behind Netflixs Unbelievabl</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1605899-sosoliso-plane-crash-survivor-kechi-dazzles-fans-photoshoot-flaunts-body-pics-year.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./doja-cat.html>Doja Cat (Rapper and Singer-Songwriter)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lassemblee-abroge-le-versement-transport-interstitiel-destine-aux-regions.html>L'Assemble abroge le versement transport interstitiel destin aux rgions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./projet-de-loi-3ds-lassemblee-adopte-et-modifie-les-disposition-sur-le-logement-et-lurbanisme.html>l'Assemble adopte et modifie les disposition sur le logement et l'urbanisme</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./publication-dun-projet-de-ccag-fournitures-courantes-et-services.html>Publication d'un projet de CCAG fournitures courantes et services</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaSync.
